"In a world governed by strategic interests and geographical policies, US President Donald Trump has sparked widespread controversy with his plan to displace 2.2 million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Egypt and Jordan.
This plan, which was justified in phrases such as ""cleansing"" of Gaza from its residents after a 15 -month destroyer, faces major legal and international obstacles, inspired by historical strategies that had previously failed to achieve its goals.
In this article, we review the legal dimensions of this controversial plan, and shed light on historical attempts of forced displacement, and we discuss the mechanisms through which Egypt and Jordan can, along with the international community, address these plans, with a focus on promoting the steadfastness of the Palestinians as a strategic option that preserves their rights And their national identity.
The statements of US President Donald Trump regarding a plan to deport Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt and Jordan in a complex international context characterized by escalating tensions in the Middle East, where Gaza witnessed repeated Israeli wars that led to the deterioration of humanitarian conditions.
These statements were associated with the plan of the ""Deal of the Century"" launched by Trump as part of a political settlement aimed at strengthening the interests of Israel by providing promises Economic for the Palestinians without meeting their legitimate political rights, which was widely rejected.
It also coincided with the Trump administration pushing towards signing normalization agreements between Israel and a number of Arab countries (Abraham Conventions), which contributed to reducing pressure on Israel towards the Palestinian issue. Internationally, the plan came in light of American tensions with Iran, which supports the Palestinian armed factions in Gaza, with the aim of weakening Iranian influence in the region.
Internally, Trump was seeking to enhance his popularity in his pro -Israel base, especially evangelical Christians, in the context of preparing for the elections, while exerting pressure on Egypt and Jordan to assume additional responsibilities towards Palestinian refugees, in a way that reduces Israel any political, economic or security burdens.
History has witnessed multiple attempts to deport the Palestinians or resettle them outside their homeland, all of which have failed to achieve their goals due to political complications and popular resistance.
Among the most prominent of these attempts is the settlement project in Sinai in 1955, which was proposed by Israel with British and American support to resettle Palestinian refugees in North Sinai, but it faced a firm Egyptian rejection led by Gamal Abdel Nasser and an opposition Stead Palestinian.
Attempts to settle the Palestinians in Jordan also emerged during the 1960s and 1970s, which caused the escalation of tension between the Palestinian factions and the Jordanian regime, and ended with the events of September in 1970.
Likewise, the United Nations and Western countries have put forward plans such as international resettlement programs via ""UNRWA"", which called for the resettlement of the Palestinians in host countries in exchange for financial support, but they met a decisive rejection of Palestinian refugees who adhered to the right to return, and the Arab countries that were afraid of liquidating the Palestinian cause or Polishing political balance. The reasons for the failure of these attempts are due to the Palestinian adherence to his national rights, and the Arab countries refused to hold them responsible for resolving the issue on behalf of Israel.
For decades, Israel has sought to displace the Palestinians, especially in the Gaza Strip, using security and military excuses to evacuate residential areas and create a demographic change that serves its strategic interests. These attempts began early, but they appeared clearly during a military operation called the steadfast shelf in 2014, as the occupation army targeted the northern Gaza Strip, such as Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia, with intense bombing, with warnings to the residents to evacuate Their homes. Despite a temporary displacement of some families to shelter centers, most of the population returned upon the end of the fighting, which led to the failure of Israel's attempt to make a permanent demographic change.
In subsequent years, the Israeli targets became more clear through the statements of prominent officials, confirming the endeavor to displace or liquidate Palestinians. For example, the Israeli National Security Minister, Etamar bin Ghaffir, called for ""resettlement of hundreds of thousands of Gaza population"", while the Minister of Finance in Salail Smotrich supported measures aimed at a demographic change in the Strip. These statements sparked widespread international condemnation and described as evidence of Israeli intentions to make a fundamental change in the demographic Gaza composition.
During the last war on Gaza in 2023, Israeli attempts to achieve these goals escalated. Israel also explicitly announced its aim to evacuate the northern Gaza Strip by allegedly eliminating the resistance tunnels and the Hamas infrastructure. As Israel resorted to the use of intense bombing and mass warning to force the population to go to the south.
Despite the severity of the bombing and the targeting of large areas such as Jabalia, Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun, as well as health infrastructure Especially Kamal Adwan Hospital, the Palestinians resisted these pressures, considering that the evacuation paves the process of permanent forced displacement. With the ends of the operations, the residents gradually returned to their homes, showing Israel's failure to impose a permanent demographic change.
In this context, the Israeli historian Beni Morris highlights in his writings, such as ""1948 and then"" and ""Nakba: The story of the Arab-Israeli conflict"", that the Israeli policies towards the Palestinians have always included the element of forced displacement as part of a strategic plan.
Morris notes that the Palestinian displacement during the Nakba in 1948 was not merely a result of the war, but rather was part of a deliberate policy of ethnic cleansing with the aim of reducing the number of Arab population within the occupied territories. It also confirms that subsequent attempts, including the major wars such as the steadfast shelf and the war on Gaza in 2023, were aimed at achieving Israeli demographic hegemony, but failed due to Palestinian steadfastness and international pressure.
In addition to the military operations, an investigation of Amnesty International indicated that Israel is committing acts that amount to genocide, including deliberate killing and physical and psychological harm to the population, in addition to being subjected to them For harsh living conditions aimed at destroying them. These policies reflect a clear Israeli attempt to liquidate the Palestinian presence in Gaza through a mixture of displacement and genocide.
Israel's attempts to deport the Palestinians, despite its fierceness and continuous escalation, revealed a permanent deficit in achieving its goals. This is due to the steadfastness of the Palestinians and their insistence on adhering to their land.
International law categorically rejects forced displacement, based on major texts condemning these practices in times of war and peace. The Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 stipulates in Article 49 the ban on the forced transportation of the population from the occupied lands, and Article 147 describes forced displacement as a serious violation and war crime.
The statute of the International Criminal Court (Rome 1998) also strengthens this position, where Article 8 (2) (B) (8) (8) criminalizes illegal displacement, while Article 7 (1) (d) is forced displacement a crime against humanity if it is widely done. Domain or methodology.
In addition, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights stresses the right of individuals to freedom of movement and choose their place By force and ensuring the right of Palestinian refugees to return.
The displacement of the Palestinians is not only a flagrant violation of international law, but also means liquidating the Palestinian cause and burying the aspirations of the Palestinian people in building their state.
How can we talk about a Palestinian state without a people on the ground? Whether in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, or Jerusalem, the displacement aims to uproot the Palestinian people from its historical roots and turn the land into a fully Israeli settlement project, which makes any path towards a two -state solution impossible.
International laws provide a strong framework for the condemnation of forced displacement, as their texts are a reference to impose political and diplomatic pressure on Israel through international organizations such as the United Nations and the International Criminal Court.
However, the application of this law faces great challenges; The absence of effective implementation mechanisms depends heavily on the cooperation of states, which makes the implementation of rulings difficult in the event that the accused parties refuse to commit.
In addition, there is duplication of international standards where the major powers such as the United States protect Israel from international sanctions, as is documented in many decisions that have been withheld in Security Council.
The current geopolitical environment places barriers to a sufficient international consensus to impose sanctions, as happened in the United Nations General Assembly, where some countries refused to recognize displacement as a crime. To achieve actual success, international political will must be strengthened, increased popular and legal pressure, and the exploitation of legal platforms to raise coherent issues that expose these practices and put Israel under international accountability. Without this, international law will remain a powerful tool on paper, but it is in reality.
Both Egypt and Jordan oppose any attempts to forced displacement of the Palestinians as a flagrant violation of international law, especially the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, which prohibits the forced transport of the population, and the statute of the International Criminal Court that classifies forced displacement as a crime of war and a crime against humanity. It also contradicts the axioms of Arab national security and its title to support the Palestinian issue.
The two countries previously rejected similar plans because of its direct impact on internal stability in them, in addition to the failure of Israel or its Western allies to bring political solutions acceptable.
Egypt and Jordan's official and diplomatic positions With clear statements, it increases international pressure on Israel and exposes it to wide criticism, which supports the steadfastness of the Palestinians on their land and prevents the granting of any political cover for attempts to displace.
In practice, Egypt and Jordan can take studied steps to prevent the implementation of any forced displacement plans. The border monitoring must be strengthened to ensure that the Palestinians are not forcibly displaced, while ensuring a safe and sustainable flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza to alleviate the economic and humanitarian pressures that may push the population to displace.
In this context, Egypt, in particular, should face Israeli and American pressure that may hinder the entry of aid or the transit of individuals for humanitarian purposes.
The two countries also have to support Palestinians within the sector through cooperation with international organizations, while activating regional and international coordination through the League of Arab States and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to mobilize a unified Arab position that enhances Israel's isolation on the international scene.
These efforts prevent any demographic changes in Gaza and keep the Palestinian issue in the circle of international attention, while emphasizing the right of the Palestinians to return.

"After the ""Al -Aqsa Flood"" operation, and in the Israeli war, the Gaza Strip, which took the genocide pattern since its first moments; The public statements rejecting the displacement of the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip escalated.
These statements reflected real discussions that are in secret about the goals of the Israeli war on Gaza, and quickly to reveal the position of a document of the Israeli Intelligence Ministry headed by Minister Jeila Gamalil, bearing the date of October 13, 2023, i.e. less than a week after the war, recommended that the Gaza Strip be occupied and the displacement of the Palestinians from it To Sinai.
The document preferred the option of displacement on other alternatives, which is to return the Palestinian Authority to the rule of the Gaza Strip, or the establishment of a local Arab rule. As for ""Israel"" strategically, this option, according to the authors of the document, needs a firm position on the political level and the approval of the states United American, and other countries supported by ""Israel"".
The document developed a general plan to re -occupy the Gaza Strip, starting with displacement Its population is from north to south, and in the meantime a gradual cleansing campaign for Hamas and its tunnels begins; In order to ultimately transfer the population from the Gaza Strip to northern Sinai.
And it is possible to look at the patterns taken by the Israeli war on Gaza, exploring that it was already guided by this plan, which if it opposed it public statements by the US Secretary of State at the time, Anthony Blinkin, then the merely out of these statements is a disclosure of deliberations that were taking place in a serious manner in the scenes The administration of the war on Gaza.
Plinken's public statements that reject the displacement were coming in the midst of leaks that talk about his pressure personally on a number of Arab countries to receive the residents of the Gaza Strip after their displacement, which in turn reflected in Arab statements that show real concern about serious pressures on Arab countries to accept receiving the residents of the Gaza Strip The most prominent of which was the statement of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi at a press conference that he collected with German Chancellor Olaf Schultz on October 18, 2023, in which he said: ""If there is an idea for displacement, the Negev desert is in Israel, the Palestinians can be displaced to it until Israel has finished its declared mission to liquidate Resistance, or armed groups: Hamas, Islamic jihad, and others, then return them if it wants, but Egypt cannot bear the consequences of the transfer of residents of the Gaza Strip to it in a loose military operation that may last for years, which would turn Sinai into a base for the resistance, and end peace between Egypt and Israel.
Such statements could not come out, had it not been for real pressure that would have been seeking to translate the Israeli extermination war on Gaza to re -occupy the Strip and displace its population into Egypt, then annexed its lands.
Some of these pressures in their public expressions were convinced of humanitarian covers calling for the protection of Palestinian civilians from Israeli bombing in safe areas on the border with Egypt.
Fifteen months after the Israeli war on Gaza, and after the completion of the signing of the first phase of ""the prisoner exchange agreement between Hamas and Israel, and returning to sustainable calm in order to achieve a permanent ceasefire between the two parties,"" the statements of the American president just come to the White House, Donald, come Trump, on his efforts to persuade Egypt, Jordan and other Arab countries to receive the residents of the Gaza Strip, after media reports that talked about the research research Trump is the possibility of transporting residents of the Gaza Strip To Indonesia temporarily until the reconstruction of the sector.
Trump's statements, which are invoked by the humanitarian situation in Gaza, are clearly concept in terms of the will to displace the residents of the Gaza Strip in accordance with the Israeli founding plan for the war of genocide, as it was the beginning of the war, and that may enhance opinions that go beyond the interpretation of the Israeli war on Gaza as an Israeli/ American war. To say that its goals are the subject of agreement between the Israelis and the Americans, including the displacement of the Palestinians From the Gaza Strip, and in a transient manner, that is, the position of the American Foundation, with its fixed and established devices.
Trump's comments not only reveal the real American position regarding the Israeli war and its final goals, but also reveals the failure of the Israeli war to accomplish this goal at the time specified by an American, the American frustration appeared in the length of this war quickly, as in statements to Anthony Blink in December 2023 He said in it: ""If the enthusiasm handed its weapons, the war will end immediately.""
And if the war in its eternal pattern has become long in its third month, this means that it did not reach its fifteenth month except with an American cover, to achieve What can be accomplished from its targets, and that the resistance of the resistance, and the Israelis incurred continuous losses in their soldiers and equipment, in addition to the depletion of their army and society, which failed the goal of displacement, and which was one of its accelerating features in the last months of the war, destroying the entire cities of the northern Gaza Strip; Jabalia, Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun.
Reading the military position after the war that reached this long length, in other statements to Benkin on January 14, 2025, in which he said: ""The defeat of Hamas with military solutions is not possible, and what is happening in the north of Gaza is evidence of this,"" noting that Hamas recruited elements New as much as you lost.
The extensive summary of this is that the length of the war was associated with dangerous Israeli goals on the future The fatal in the Strip, or as Trump expressed by saying: ""The city really needs to be rebuilt ... something must happen, but it is a site Destroyed. So I prefer to cooperate with some Arab countries and build housing elsewhere, perhaps there they can live in peace. ""
These statements explain the goals of the systematic Israeli destruction of the Gaza Strip. Direct goals are:
First: Revenge to raise the Israeli morale and restore deterrence and the head of the Palestinians from the feasibility of their resistance.
Second: Covering the offering of the ground forces with carpet bombing to liquidate the resistance and Hamas.
However, the strategic goal is to displace the population directly due to the Israeli power, as it is an ethnic cleansing this time with an explicit genocide.
This is what reminds of previous statements by the Israeli Finance Minister, the leader of the Religious Zionism Party, in Salail Smotrich, in which he said: “Encouraging voluntary immigration is the possibility of opening up, and it is possible to create a situation that makes Gaza in half of its current population within two years, with full control of a state Israel.
What Trump finally said is identical to what Smotrich said, Trump talks about the displacement of half of the population of the Gaza Strip, and he invokes The situation created by the Israeli war to justify it.
What should be emphasized is that the displacement plans for the residents of the Gaza Strip are constantly raised within the Israeli establishment since 1967 by Moshe Dayan, and in the Eagal Alon plan.
This is what was repeated in many plans, despite the strategic and ideological importance of the West Bank, the Israeli vision remained constantly judge the necessity of the displacement of the residents of the Gaza Strip and its inclusion in the end, for the purpose of the comprehensive Judaization of the ""complete land of Israel"" on the one hand, and on the other hand, and on the other hand To address the dilemma of poverty in the Israeli strategic depth, a dilemma that reveals today in solutions New lands in Syria, and strive to stay in strategic points inside Lebanon after the recent war on Lebanon.
The steadfastness of the Palestinians in Gaza, and the regeneration of the resistance in it, since the occupation of the Strip, is the one who failed these Israeli plans. This war, which tried to turn the Israeli ordeal into an opportunity, would not have stopped if the resistance was broken or surrendered, as it would become a negative way to push the Palestinians towards immigration.
So, while Trump carried, Netanyahu signed the agreement with Hamas, after he was evaded The latter of it is much and long, this was only because the war has long long after the unimaginable Hamas movement from all regional and international actors.
However, this does not mean at the end of the matter regarding the attempt to achieve the goals of this war, and not limited to the Gaza Strip, as the Western Bank is more important for the Israelis, and its plans were announced, and Trump's plan to liquidate the Palestinian issue known medialy as the ""deal of the century"" which was presented in its past mandate, It requires fixing settlements in the West Bank and annexing them to ""Israel"" while subjecting the entire Palestinian field to security hegemony Absolute Israeli.
And if the steadfastness of the Palestinian resistance prevented the implementation of the goal of displacement by direct military payment, then investing in the destruction is the next plan to push the Palestinians towards immigration, and by direct pressure on a number of Arab countries to receive them, which requires these countries direct confrontation for this plan with the explicit support for the steadfastness of the Palestinians in the sector Gaza, and in order to overcome the Israeli will, starting from direct entry into relief and construction of housing Temporary, and at the same time starting a return Reconstruction.
It remains for these countries, if you possess the correct vision and independent will, support the Palestinian resistance as the basic condition for curbing Israeli being, especially since the Israeli intentions to compensate for poverty in the strategic depth are practically embodied and transcends the Palestinian geographical space, and what cannot be geographically collected is working on ""Israel"" to collect it By devoting its hegemony over the countries of the region.
What confirmed the Israeli war on the Gaza Strip, and the steadfastness of the Palestinian resistance in it despite the impossible circumstances, is that ""Israel"" protects itself by extermination first, and in the United States secondly, which is something and as much as it should raise the concerns of all the countries of the region, it confirms the possibility of constructing a regional balance In confronting ""Israel"", which is unable to achieve its goals without the United States of America.

While tens of thousands of displaced people were gathering near the Netsarim axis to return to the war of the war, US President Donald Trump made statements in which he expressed his desire to host Jordan and Egypt to Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.
On Sunday, Trump spoke on the presidential plane about a plan to ""purify"" Gaza, saying: ""We are talking about a million and a half million people to purify the entire area. As you know, over the centuries, this region has witnessed many conflicts. I do not know, but it must happen What is. ""
American statements were met with a unified position, by Jordan, Egypt, the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian factions, which is completely the refusal of the displacement.
The next day, large numbers of displaced people returned on foot, carrying bags or vehicles, to the coastal road towards the northern Gaza Strip areas from which they were displaced during the war.

Hamas issued a statement saying that ""the Palestinian people refused to surrender to the crimes of forced displacement, especially in the northern Gaza Strip, and categorically rejects any plans to deport and displace him from their land.""

The Palestinian presidency expressed its strong rejection and condemnation of any projects It aims to displace the Palestinian people from the Gaza Strip, and ""it is the matter that is a transgression of the red lines that we have repeatedly warned.""
The presidency added that ""the Palestinian people will not abandon their lands and sanctities, and we will not allow the repetition of the calamities that came to our people in the years 1948 and 1967, and our people will not leave.""

Political analyst Sharhabeel Al -Gharib, who inhabits the Gaza Strip, assured the BBC, that there is a popular rejection in the Gaza Strip, and a state of ridicule of statements.
The stranger explained that the Palestinian position is based on three pillars, which are the popular level, the level of the factions, and the official level (the Palestinian Authority).
He said that these combined pillars refuse and say, ""No to reproduce the deal of the century,"" adding that ""the Palestinian people are the owner of the land. It cannot be accepted to be abandoned from its land.""
The stranger considered that ""forced displacement"" is merely an illusion, and it failed during the war in front of the Palestinians' adherence to their land, as they were displaced from the north of Gaza to the south, and they refused to come out towards the Egyptian border.
The stranger said that Israel paved the displacement by ""killing all forms of life in the Gaza Strip.""
Al -Ghariba considered in an interview with the BBC that Trump's statements lack a real vision and plan, and he said that The US President is trying to reproduce the deal of the century and impose it on the region.
The administration of former US President Joe Biden has thought about the idea of ??transferring some of the population temporarily in the early war, but Jordan and Egypt insisted on their rejection that Washington quickly abandoned the idea, according to the newspaper ""Times of Israel"".
In 1948, more than 760,000 Palestinians were displaced and expelled during the war that erupted during the establishment of the State of Israel.
About 80 percent of Gaza residents are refugees, children and grandchildren of refugees who left their homes during ""Nakba"" in 1948.
There are more than six million Palestinian refugees in the region registered with UNRWA.
During the 1967 war during which Israel occupied the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, more displacement occurred.

An Israeli, the statements received acceptance at the far right of the Israeli right, as the Israeli Finance Minister of Salafel Smotrich on Sunday saw the proposal of the US President to transfer the residents of Gaza to Jordan and Egypt a ""great idea.""
""The idea of ??helping them in Find other places to start a new and good life is a great idea. After years of glorification of terrorism, they will be able to build a new and good life elsewhere. ""
He added: ""Only thinking outside the box with new solutions will provide a solution to peace and security.""
He stressed: ""I will work with the Prime Minister and the Security Council to ensure that there is a practical plan to implement this as soon as possible.""
""In the long term, to encourage immigration is the only solution that will bring peace and security to Israel and also reduce the suffering of the residents of Gaza. I work with the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers to prepare an executive plan and ensure the achievement of this vision on the ground,"" according to the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper. .
""One of our demands from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to strengthen voluntary immigration. When the head of the greatest superpower in the world, Trump, puts this idea, It is worthy of the Israeli government - strengthening immigration now! ""
During the war, Smotrich wrote on Facebook, welcoming ""the voluntary migration of the Arabs of Gaza to the countries of the world.""
She invited the Minister of Intelligence Israeli Gila Gamaleel ""to"" encourage voluntary resettlement of the Palestinians from Gaza outside the Gaza Strip, for humanitarian reasons. ""

Amman has been repeating her rejection of the displacement plans and made Jordan an alternative homeland for the Palestinians. One of the most famous positions was the three Jordanian monarchs, Abdullah II, who he worked as wearing the military uniform in 2019, when he said, ""No, on Jerusalem, no on the alternative homeland, no on resettlement.""
In 2023, Bishr Al -Khasawneh said during his assumption of the Prime Minister in Jordan, that ""any attempts or circumstances to displace the Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank are a red line, and Jordan will consider it as a declaration of war.""
After Trump's statements, the Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Al -Safadi appeared, saying: ""We refused to displace, not to change,"" noting that the Jordanian position is firmly established that the kingdom could not deviate from.
He said: ""We work according to our constants, and resolve the Palestinian issue in Palestine, Jordan for Jordanians and Palestine for the Palestinians.""
The next day, Al -Safadi addressed the parliament, saying: ""No displacement. This is a fixed position that has not changed, and will not change ... We address with all our capabilities for every presentation that does not consistent with our national interests.""
He described the Prime Minister Former Jordanian Taher Al -Masry, in his speech with BBC, Trump's statements are ""a clear infringement in every sense of the word, empty, united, provocative and unacceptable words.""
Al -Masry said, ""Trump gave himself the right to decide what he wants ... which is completely contrary to the required stability in the Middle East, and what has been going on for many months, aiming to create a new Middle East.""
He added: ""Palestine is for the Palestinians, and Jordan for Jordanians, and this is fixed and will not change.""
Al -Masry referred to the scene in Gaza, and talked about the return of hundreds of thousands whose homes were destroyed in adherence to their land, adding: ""The Palestinian adheres to his land, and he will not accept to leave it whatever happens.""
A week after the start of the war in Gaza, the Jordanian monarch warned during his meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinkkin in Amman from any attempt to displace the Palestinians to neighboring countries.
Political analyst Labib Qamhawi told the BBC: ""The United States was not doing in secret that Trump is now in public,"" adding that Trump is trying to impose his opinion on the political force and the strength of the state on both Jordan and Egypt.
Trump's choice of the two countries comes due to the presence of common borders with occupied Palestinian lands, according to Qamhawi.
He hinted that Trump threatens to use a weapon Aid and support weapon as a way to pressure Jordan and Egypt to accept this.
Last week, the United States froze its foreign aid, with the exception of that introduction to Egypt and Israel as well as emergency food aid, pending a full review of the questionnaire whether it is compatible with the policy that Donald Trump intends to follow.
Qamhawi said that the Palestinians are ""a people attached to their land"", and they return in the Gaza Strip to their destroyed homes and piles of rubble.
Regarding the ability to resist Trump's pressure, Qamhawi said that Jordan is a poor country and put it weaker than Egypt, but the position of the Jordanian people on the issue of displacement is clear and decisive, and they cannot accept this, even if the government accepts.
He added: ""I do not think that a country like Egypt lacks the ingredients that enable it to take independent positions, and it can withstand any American political pressure.""

As for the Egyptian position, it does not seem different from the Jordanian position, as Cairo announced its rejection of any forced displacement of the Palestinians.
A statement by the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stressed ""Egypt's continued support for the steadfastness of the Palestinian people on its land and its adherence to its legitimate rights in its land and country.""
The statement said that Cairo ""rejects any A prejudice to those unusable rights, whether through settlement or the inclusion of the land or by evacuating that land from their owners through displacement or encouraging transportation or uprooting Palestinians from their land, whether it is temporary or long -term.
And previously, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi warned that the displacement would be aimed at ""liquidating the Palestinian issue.""
During the first month of the war, the Egyptian President said that Israel could move the residents of the Gaza Strip to the Negev desert until the end of the war in Gaza, and rejected the idea of ??displacement to the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula.
A spokesman for the League of Arab States, Jamal Rushdi, told the BBC that attempts to displace the Palestinians, or remove the Palestinian people, whether through displacement or what is known as the scenarios of the annexation, or even the expansion of settlements, adequately rejected ideas and attempts, because they are contrary to international law.
After Trump announced on Sunday, his intention to contact Sisi, an official Egyptian source denied conducting contact regarding the issue of resettlement of the Palestinians in Egypt and Jordan.
Ashraf Sphinx, the editor -in -chief of Al -Ahram newspaper, described Trump's statements as ""shocking"" and saw it as a recipe to ignite the area.
The Sphinx told the BBC, that The Palestinians will not accept the displacement, and indicated that Egypt, Jordan and any Arab country will refuse to receive the Palestinians.
The Sphinx saw that the deportation plan for Egypt and Jordan is unrealistic and unrealistic, and any deportation will turn into permanent displacement.
He referred to Cairo's warning of an Israeli plan for displacement, and said that Egypt had previously hinted that it would prevent the displacement, even by force.
The Sphinx said that Cairo had received financial offers and temptations for displacement, but it rejects a form and content.
Political analyst Sharhabeel Al -Gharib saw that Jordan and Egypt's positions on the issue of deportation are ""very important"", and he saw that Trump's statements ""may be maneuvers to explore Jordanian and Egyptian positions.""
It is strange that the implementation of the Trump plan is subject to Jordan and Egypt's positions after the position of the Palestinian people.
Al -Gharib called on BBC, Egypt to take steps to enhance the steadfastness of the Palestinian people in their land.
Al -Gharib spoke about the necessity of steadfast these positions in front of economic pressures and American material temptations.",UK

For the second time in a week, US President Donald Trump renews his statements about the acceptance of Jordan and Egypt to receive the people of Gaza, after a proposal submitted by Saturday, January 25, 2025 for ""clearing"" the sector, which he said has become a ""devastating place"".
On Thursday, January 30, 2025, the US President said in a press conference, in response to a journalist's question about the possibility of Jordan and Egypt to host Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, saying: ""You will declare this.""
""We have provided a lot of support for them, and they will declare what we asked of them,"" Trump added in his speech.
Jordan had responded to the first statements of the American president to reject, stressing the words of his foreign minister, Ayman Al -Safadi, that ""Oman holds a two -state solution, a single way to achieve security, stability and peace in the region.""
As for Egypt, President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi said, ""The transfer of the Palestinian people from its place is an injustice that we cannot participate in,"" and he saw that in this step ""the instability of Egyptian national security and Arab national security in our region.""

These statements sparked widespread controversy between Jordanians and Egyptians, especially as they came with the validity of an agreement Stopping fire in Gaza and the escalation of the humanitarian crisis in the ""destructive"" sector.
These statements come within the framework of continuous research on possible solutions to the Palestinian crisis, as they have sparked strong reactions to social media platforms by the peoples of the countries concerned, who see in this statement a ""challenge to their national and national positions.""
In another way to express the rejection of the Trump plan, social media platforms, at the Egyptian level, witnessed calls to come out with popular demonstrations that reach the Egyptian side from the Rafah crossing, rejecting the Palestinian displacement plans towards the republic, which shares with the Gaza Strip up to 12 kilometers, near The city of Rafah.
Separate areas in Egypt on Thursday night, January 30, the movement of buses carrying large numbers of participants towards North Sinai Governorate, where the demonstrators raised slogans, including “No to displace the Palestinian people” and “not to liquidate the Palestinian issue”, along with the flags of Egypt and Palestine.

Moataz Al -Rahala's tweet on the ""X"" platform expresses Jordan's calmness in interacting with American statements, as he says that Jordan does not rush to respond ""nervously or cramping"", but rather adopts positions Daughter and logical, stressing that Jordan responded ""proactive and for a long time.""
Patter Warfad says in a post on Facebook that Trump's plan appears to be ""impossible to implement"" and believes that ""the steadfastness of the people of Gaza in the face of genocide"" and ""Jordanian diplomacy"" are able to deter the American plan.
He shows and fills his concern about what he described as ""the fifth inner queue that shows a hostility to the Jordanian state more than his hostility to Israel.""
Ali Arefia, condemned Trump's statements, and demanded ""the heads of the Egyptian parties, and with them all the heads of union and universities, and the heads of the People's Assembly and the Shura and their deputies - in the ways of the doors of the American embassy and present a strongly worded protest note.""
As for Hani Nesira, the Egyptian writer and journalist, as he knows about himself on X, he sees that the American plan ""justifies an unprecedented and potential return for extremism and violence groups.""
Trump's statements ""are nothing but bullying and muscle review,"" according to a tweet written by the judge’s statement on the X platform, in which she said: “Trump himself is abandoned and occupied to a land that is not his land and bargains for the displacement of the Palestinians and they are the owners of the land.”
An account that came under the name ""Change"" believes that the American and Israeli desire to control the Gaza Strip and the displacement of its inhabitants comes from being ""possessing its wealth from Gas in the sea and the land ""with the aim of converting it into a"" tourist area "".
Majid Abu Diak, who knows himself on ""X"" as a Palestinian writer and researcher, says that the refusal of Jordan and Egypt is ""a duty and worthy"", and the Gazans say: ""This is a people who does not accept the world in its religion and country, and it is the one who failed and still is the plot of displacement on 15 months. ”
While the Jordanian and Egyptian positions, officially and popularly, denounce the American plan, the voices of activists on social media, criticizing the ""Arab Silence"" towards the ""displacement"" plan.
An account called ""Ahmed Guevara"" criticizes the ""X"" platform not to invite any Arab country to a ""conference or initiative"" aimed at rebuilding Gaza and preventing the displacement of its residents, considering that ""delay in reconstruction means pushing for a soft displacement and participation in the plan.""
As for an account that came under the name ""Ruro Mohamed"", he believes that the Arab silence comes within the framework of supporting ""the implementation of the Ben Gurion scheme instead of the Suez Canal.""
Another account called ""Cape Barthing"" tweeted, carrying a picture that brought together the Egyptian and Palestinian flags, looking for the position of Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Iran on the ""displacement of the Gazans"", and asked: ""Did Gaza remain a negotiating or coveted paper after the displacement?!""
The Mahdawi regime, the editor -in -chief of Watan newspaper, sees, Independent from America, in a tweet on the X platform that ""the displacement plan ... may not need Sisi or King Abdullah's approval, but rather a test balloon of what may happen in the future.""
Mahdawi expects several ""black"" scenarios, while concluding that the issue ""goes beyond mere approval or reluctance"", and says: ""We are facing two systems belonging to America who do not have any strengths, but rather they revive American aid.""
It seems that Trump's statements regarding the deportation of the Palestinians from Gaza to Jordan and Egypt are still raising widespread interaction, whether officially or popular in the two countries.
While officials in Amman and Cairo categorically showed this plan, citizens and activists emphasized social media platforms, their adherence to their positions rejecting the displacement plans, stressing the ""need to support the Palestinian issue"" and not to allow any attempts to impose ""imposed"" solutions that contradict the national rights of the Palestinian people.
In light of this atmosphere, the reactions to these statements continue to shed light on the complexity of the Palestinian file in the region, with a focus on supporting Palestinian rights and achieving a just and sustainable solution.",UK
"The readers of this angle will remember that, since the outbreak of the war on Gaza, I have been shouting, warning that the Israeli occupation and aggression will not be limited to Gaza alone, but that all countries of the region are threatened with danger.
As I expected, the Israeli occupation expanded its aggression to include part of Lebanon and Syria after Gaza, and it was not satisfied with that, but rather launched air strikes in Yemen, Iraq, and Iran.
Today, US President Donald Trump is seeking to displace the Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt and Jordan, and despite these countries' rejection of this plan, he insists, saying: ""They will take the Palestinians, they will take them"", as if the matter is imposed on them. This sentence is not just a permit, but rather a clear threat.
Is it possible that nearly two million Palestinians be displaced to Jordan and Egypt, then Gaza is annexed to Israel? It should be understood that this plan is not limited to Gaza only, but also includes Palestinians in the West Bank.
If Egypt and Jordan's accounts assume that they can avoid this plan by negotiating with the United States and Israel, in the hope of preventing the flow of two million refugees to their lands, then these accounts will be in error. But Lebanon itself has already entered into negotiations with France The United States, and this did not prevent the occupation and destruction of its lands.
We have to realize a fixed fact: Israel does not abandon its goals, but only to implement its implementation and re -distribute it in stages. The ""Promised Land"" project, which is the essence of biblical ideology, is no longer just a religious dream, but rather turned into a geopolitical goal adopted by the Evangelical elites in the United States and the Zionists from the Jews.
This means that the Israeli expansion is no longer just as an ambition, but rather an existing military project on which long -term strategies are drawn in the Pentagon, Tel Aviv and the White House.
Consequently, sitting at the negotiating table with Israel and the United States will not prevent occupation and destruction, but rather the only solution lies in building broad and strong regional alliances. Nothing can stop Israeli/ American expansion except a unified regional entity that brings together the affected forces of these policies.
Egypt and Jordan are aware that if you receive the displaced Palestinians, they will make the biggest mistake in their history. The matter is not only related to the economic and social crisis that will arise internally. Rather, the emptying of the Palestinian land will open the door for Israel to expand, and will make these two countries in a position. He is forgiven in the eyes of the Islamic world.
The reception of these refugees will create a state of chaos and internal turmoil in both countries, and will exacerbate their political and economic crises, and will reflect negatively on their regional relations and alliances. Ultimately, the two countries will slide into a state of instability, which is in the interest of Israel and the United States, which will then find a justification for intervention for ""security reasons"" and perhaps occupying parts of their lands.
But this scheme will not stop here. Later, the oil countries in the Arabian Gulf will be subjected to tremendous pressure to force them to provide Israel with energy, and if they refuse, they will face direct threats to freeze their assets, impose economic sanctions, and lift US military protection from them.
As for Syria, it will be subjected to political extortion to force it to abandon the Golan, as well as from the Hermon region, rich in water, for the benefit of Israel. If you do not respond, the military occupation will be expanded, the obstruction of any international recognition of the new government, and the imposition of suffocating sanctions on them.
In Lebanon, any new political system will find itself in front of a plan to extract the south under security pretexts and the creation of ""safe areas"".
In the eastern Mediterranean, pressure will increase to spread New US military bases in Cyprus, under the pretext of enhancing Israel's security, and will exercise pressure on Türkiye to rearrange its relations with Israel, under the threat to destabilize its economy.
In other words, they did not stop at Gaza and Lebanon, they will not stop at Egypt and Jordan.
Consider the scene: Trump wants to buy Greenland, seeks to make Canada an American state, control the Panama channel, and interfere with the internal policies of Germany and Britain. Is it logical to expect him to stop there in the Middle East?
Why is there no Middle Eastern alliance?
The countries of the region must understand the extent of the threat to it. The exit of this predicament is only through the formation of strong alliances in the areas of security, defense, economy and development.
I have already referred to the ""intertwined departments theory"" in previous articles, a vision that must be seriously presented to the agenda of the countries concerned. Today there is a talk about a tripartite alliance that includes Turkey, Iraq and Syria under the name ""Tigris- Euphrates Alliance"", but it must be expanded to include other countries.
Why is there no ""Eastern Mediterranean"" coalition? Why are countries like Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Syria, Cyprus, Tunisia, Libya, Morocco, and Algeria?
but rather This alliance can extend to the European countries whose relations with the United States, such as Spain, Italy, Malta, Greece, and even France, have been affected.
The countries of the Mediterranean civilization, which participate in a long cultural and historical heritage, can employ these common denominators to confront the expansionist ambitions of the United States and Israel.

British newspapers dealt with their articles and analyzes a number of issues and issues, including: US President Donald Trump's suggestions threatening ""weak hopes"" for Palestinians in Gaza, in addition to the increasing population and immigration in Britain, as well as nervous diversity; Is it a disability or a talent.
The Guardian newspaper considered in its editorial that Trump's proposal to ""cleanse"" the Gaza Strip by deporting more than a million and a half million Palestinians temporarily outside the Strip or for a long time to Jordan and Egypt - ""a new threat"" to them.
The newspaper said that ""there is no reason"" pushes the Palestinians to believe that there is an opportunity to return due to their long history with displacement.
""It seems that (Trump's proposal) is another catastrophe,"" she added.
The newspaper pointed out that Trump's talk about his concern about the Palestinians and that he wants them to live in a safer and more comfortable place, does not change the fact that it will be a ""war crime.""

And removing the Palestinians from the north ""has become more difficult now"" after thousands returned to it, according to the newspaper.
The Guardian said that Trump's comments are ""music for the ears"" of the extreme Israeli ears, and it may be to help Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to maintain his coalition.
She drew attention to the fact that ""Trump's proposal does not need to be practical to be harmful"", but rather that it would ""strengthen"" the extreme right in Israel, the motivated, after the abolition of US sanctions on settlers involved in violence in the West Bank, and ""increase the marginalization of the Palestinians"" .
The newspaper considered that Trump appears to be seen as ""an obstacle to the development of real estate and its major deals that he discussed for a long time, and not as human beings who have the right to express their opinion in their lives.""
The Guardian said that the United States' commitment to the two -state solution ""often seems theoretically"" but it is ""still important"", noting that the Palestinians ""still need a long -term future in their own country.""

The Times newspaper published an article written by Alice Thomson, in which she talks about nervous diversity and how it can be dealt with positively, instead of judging him that he - with his name - mental disability.
Alice remembers a dialogue with Bill Gates, in which he said to her: “If I had grew up these days, the doctors would have made my condition. United.
The same applies to Elon Musk, according to his biography writer, and Liter Isaxon. It is reported that the owner of Twitter suffers from a kind of autism. ""I prepared the invention of the electric car, and I am in the process of sending humans to the moon, do you think that I grew up in an ordinary upbringing,"" Mask said about himself in a television interview.
The writer adds to the list other brilliant names in money, business and technology, all of whom were diagnosed with autism or hyperactivity, including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, Charles Bronson, and James Dyson, all of whom have proven their extraordinary intelligence.
The writer says that the diagnosis of children in these cases of nervous diversity often leads to disabled, and they end up marginalizing in society, and a heavy burden on their families, who bear their care, and deal with their various behavior.
And you see that the first is for the government to search for ways to enable these people to exploit their own talents, and to find jobs and activities that suit their capabilities, They benefit from it and serve the community.
It warns that a large number of children with autism in Britain end up in the hands of gangs, which exploit them in their criminal acts. The numbers show that only three in 10 of those with autism find fixed jobs, while 77 percent of them want to work.
A study carried out by the National Autism Society in Britain indicates that 60 percent of people with autism depend financially on their families, and 40 percent of them live with their families.
Alice believes that the nervous diversity must deal with it as a unique, unique efficiency, instead of considering it in all cases a mental disability, and a burden on families and society.

The Independent newspaper published an article written by John Rantol, commenting on the recent British statistics that talk about immigration and its impact on the high population of the country.
John says that the National Bureau of Statistics indicates that the population in Britain will rise by 5 million people within 10 years due to immigration, ""but without immigrants we will turn to a single and isolated island.""
The writer states that public opinion is contradictory in Britain. Immigration is out of people, but they appreciate the role of immigrants. Most of the British are calling for a reduction in the level of immigration, but when you ask them about the actions of the immigrants, they welcome more of them.
The writer believes that those who look at the numbers of the Statistics Bureau as a disturbing indication, they must remember that economic success is linked to immigration as well.
John says that immigration opponents can respond that Britain should train adequate numbers of workers he needs. But the issue is not the same as the simplicity.
The only way to complete the migration - the goal that Nigel Faraj, leader of the Islah party - seeks to ""sink"" the country in debts and financial crises, and people escape from it instead of immigration to it. And ""then the doctors we train to Australia and Canada leave,"" according to the article.",UK

International newspapers have been built with reports, analyzes and opinion articles to comment on US President Donald Trump's announcement that the United States ""will control the Gaza Strip"", at a press conference in the White House with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The British Guardian newspaper published a report of its correspondent in Washington David Smith, entitled ""Hello in the Trump world, where the real estate man sees the ruins of Gaza dollars.""
The newspaper said that the eastern hall of the White House, where the press conference between Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu was held, the first foreign leader to visit Washington during the Trump era, turned into a wrestling circuit between journalists to cover the important event that was delayed an hour and a half.
She added that Trump began to boast about how to build a ""beautiful"" American embassy in Jerusalem, and to talk about his predecessor Biden, and he praised the members of his administration, which he chose so far. Suddenly, the situation completely turned into a very strange thing.
Trump surprised everyone by talking about Gaza and describing it as a long time as a ""bad luck"", as if he was talking about a haunted house, according to the newspaper.

While Netanyahu was looking, and perhaps he was trying to restrain himself from Laughter, Trump talked about the construction of ""different regions"" in other countries to resettle the inhabitants of Gaza, and added: ""The costs of this can be paid by neighboring countries with great fortunes.""
""Was this a well -studied plan?"" The newspaper asked. On his perception of the new settlement areas, Trump said: ""It could be one, two, three, four, five, seven, eight, 12, it could be many sites or a large site.""
But he promised to be ""something really amazing""!

Then the surprise came when Trump said: ""The United States will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do what it takes. We will possess it,"" and he did not rule out ""sending"" American forces to control.
Trump's statements are an indication that Trump is entering a new and dangerous expansion stage, and that during his second term, the US President will play a greater role on a greater theater.
Trump's plan on Gaza ""contradicts international law""
""Trump's attack on the United States Agency for International Development is an attack on the safety of Americans"" - Washington Post
Does the relationship turn? Between Trump and Sisi to ""lukewarm"" because of Gaza? Newsweek
The newspaper described it as ""the new Julius Caesar"", and there is no longer any fear of it after the Senate has already neutralized.
But when the press conference reached the stage of questions and answers, its true motives became clear, as he said about Gaza: ""We will take over the place and its effect, and we will create thousands and thousands of jobs, and it will be something that the entire Middle East can be proud of.""
The newspaper added: ""Welcome to the Trump world in Gaza, a fictional entertainment park full of Trump towers, Trump's golf courses and robots.""
Trump added: ""I do not want to be nice, and I do not want to be a wise man, but I want Rvira Middle East (in Gaza),"" Trump added.
Netanyahu praised Trump as ""the greatest friend of Israel ever in the White House"" and said that his plan on Gaza - which the Palestinians and the neighboring countries are strongly opposed - ""deserve attention"" and ""can change history.""
But this plan did not even like some in America, including Chris Murphy, the democratic Senator who responded to Trump's proposal on social media by saying: ""He has completely lost his mind.""
We are now only the second week of Trump's rule, It seems that he intends to make this presidential period like a movie of ""Star Wars, Part Five: The Empire repeats the strikes"", or ""The Godfather (Jude Farr) Part Two"" or ""The Pastage 2: Day of Resurrection"", and today it started in Gaza, and tomorrow the rest of the world !

An opinion article in the British Telegraph newspaper warned of the danger of Trump's statements, and the writer David Krosteofer Kaufman called in his article to ""deal with this plan seriously, but not literally.""
He pointed out that its aim is to try Trump to force the Middle East leaders to take more responsibility towards the Palestinians.
The article said that, regardless of the extent to which Trump's proposal provokes the transfer of Gaza residents to another place, but it did not come from a vacuum, after nearly 16 months of war between Israel and Hamas, no party made a realistic plan if the fighting would stop.
Instead, ""Israel has committed to a fragile ceasefire, with Hamas's provocation to the world now with the ceremonies of the release of frightening hostages and disturbing re -armament offers ... Hamas terrorists continue to get out of their tunnels and are amazingly in good health,"" according to the newspaper.
The writer added that Israel ""failed clearly"" In her ambition to destroy the movement, which means that the Hamas militants will have another opportunity to ""suppress, torture and steal the civilian population in Gaza,"" according to the newspaper.
The article described that the reaction of leaders in the Middle East was ""angry"", and he claimed that they were ""concerned"" about the interests of their countries; Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates - all of them have no great desire to deal with ""fundamentalism and inevitable terrorism"", which accompanies ""extremist population"" such as the residents of Gaza.
Regarding the writer's definition of what Trump means to transfer the residents of Gaza, he said, ""It is unlikely to mean collective migration from Rafah to Riyadh,"" and ""it is unlikely to the same level that a large number of Gaza population will move to Jordan or Lebanon.""
As for Egypt, it is a ""completely different story"", thanks to its long borders with Gaza and the $ 1.3 billion military aid that it receives every year from the United States. As with NATO, Trump wants to work more seriously in order to obtain these funds, ""and the acceptance of some Gaza population, at least in the eyes of the White House, appears to be a fair price,"" according to the newspaper.
The writer notes that for the Gulf states Like Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, its prosperous economies may ""easily accommodate"" some skilled Gazans who have maintained the work of the sector before the war with Israel ... and that it may ""bear at least the costs of assisting"" Gaza residents, whether in the same sector or anywhere else .
The writer concluded his article by saying: ""As with a lot in the Trump world, the president's statements must be taken seriously, but not literally. Mechanisms must be devised to allow the residents of Gaza who want to leave. No one should be forced to live under the rule of Islamic fundamentalism.""

The American magazine ""Newsweek"" criticized the Trump plan in the Gaza Strip, and said in an article by writer Faisal Koti, entitled ""Trump's plan on Gaza is undermining justice and international law"", that Trump's proposal to transfer 1.5 million Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries such as Egypt and Jordan is not just a proposal ""Only misleading"", it is ""a deliberate insult to international law and the principles of justice.""
The proposal was described as ""cleansing"" of Gaza, simulating historical patterns of ethnic cleansing and carrying severe consequences for a really horrific humanitarian crisis.
The article stated that if the idea is implemented, it will ""rise to an anxious escalation In the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people and increases its suffering significantly, ""says Omar Shaker, director of the Israel and Palestine administration at Human Rights Watch.
The writer notes that international humanitarian law clearly prohibits forced transport or deportation of the population under occupation. Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states that: “The individual or collective transportation is prohibited, as well as the deportation of protected persons from the occupied territories to the lands of the occupied power or to the lands of any other country, occupied or inconsistent, regardless of its motives.”
The writer pointed out that the seventh and eighth articles of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court define forced transport as a crime against humanity and a war crime. Moreover, such a displacement undermines the basic standards of international law.
The article referred to the position of the United Nations, which indicated that ""the transfer of the Palestinians from Gaza not only violated their human rights, but also will also lead to the erosion of the two -state solution, which is depicted by decades of diplomacy.""
The magazine warned that Trump's statements, although it seemed ""far -reaching"", has shown history that the ideas that were rejected one day as they were as Strange can, over time, become applicable political discussions.
She added: ""The gradual normalization of forced displacement speech is deeply concerned, especially in light of the previous comments from the internal circle of Trump.""",UK
"US President Donald Trump seemed very serious in launching a project to displace Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Jordan and Egypt .. It seemed more confident and sure that these two countries adjacent to Palestine will accept its offer or will undergo its pressure in the end, and how it rejects, which are included in the external aid regulations The American for a long time, it is time to ""return the favor"", and do what is necessary To help the head of the great state to achieve the goals and Marami of his project that is drawn from the Zionist -religious dictionary; Seeing her and her narration.
As the observers were hot in explaining the secret of this excessive enthusiasm that swept the president who is crowded with an insulting electoral victory, closer to the ""tsunami"", a team of them went to say that the man is aware of what he says, and that he completes what the Democratic Biden administration started with the timing and hesitation, and what he started is a time The first ""deal of the century"" years ago, and that it is the one who belongs to a populist right woven from the extremist Israeli right -wing cloth Its itself, does not find an outrage in marketing and justifying the ""decisive, annexation and displacement plan"" that started as a view of a marginal current in Israel before it became a supreme strategy for the Hebrew state.
A second team said that the man depends Another tactic by provoking fear and terror among his opponents and allies, both, and that he does this to raise the price of his goods in the hope of obtaining another goods, elsewhere, but at a lower price .. Here it is said that the displacement project will be abandoned, when the first steps of Israeli normalization begin - Al -Arabi, the focus of Trump's interests and focus, and instead of being the ""state"" or ""the irreversible way for a two -state solution"", It is the price of normalization, the abandonment of a fabricated project becomes suddenly jumped to the surface, it is the required price.
A third team, he went to say that we are a test of a test, because the horror bear in the hearts of the Palestinians, Jordanians and the Egyptians, was with it, otherwise the door will remain open to offers and later deals, with ceilings and more modest prices, here the attention is turned to the West Bank, which the Israeli wants from Trump to scoop from Its land and sacred things, as a price for their acceptance of a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza, or acceptance Conditional that the Gazans remain over their national soil.
Whatever what is going on in Trump's mind, and what he plans and seeks to implement, the dropping of this project appears to be a common interest of Palestine, Jordan and Egypt, and even the Arab world in general, and failure to confront it, is never an option, no, no Especially since there are strength leaves if I can use them, or rather, if the will is available for use, it will be enough to bury it in its cradle, despite what the White House of strength and pressure leave The least:
The first of these papers; The most important of them is, the Palestinians themselves rejected this project, with actions, not only by the sayings, and what happened during the ""flood of return"" to Gaza and the north, after the Israeli evacuation of a part of the corridor of Natsarim, was a spontaneous referendum on the refusal of the displacement .. half a million Palestinians were gathered The Rafah crossing to escape towards the Sinai, gathered on the corridor of Natsarim on the journey of returning to the destroyed houses, on foot, even if It is required, to stay hours and nights on the ""Calvary Trail"" due to the Israeli procrastination with the smells of revenge and revenge.
All the Palestinian forces have made their indications of rejecting the project, and the matter was not limited to the factions, but rather overlooked them to the various activities of the Palestinian people everywhere. ""Ka'b Achilles"", the unified Palestinian position in the face of displacement, is still represented in the insistence of the authority to reject the calls of reconciliation and the arrangement of the Palestinian house And the restoration of unity, its continuation in its miserable political bets, and its uninterrupted endeavor to present the ""credentials"" to Israel and those behind it, in the hope of obtaining a ""place under the sun of the West Bank"" starting, and in Gaza if it is able to a path.
Again these papers; The Jordanian and Egyptian positions, where Oman and Cairo feels threatening their security and stability, and in the Jordanian situation on the identity and the entity if this project was written to see the light .. Here we do not talk about a solid position or support for the ""Palestinian brothers"" but rather to defensive and preventive policies; Defending the credibility of governance and governments, to preserve security and stability, and in defense of identity and existence.
Here, it is expected that the positions of the two countries will be conclusive in its clarity, and its red lines are apparent as it has not happened before. For her friendliness and earn her satisfaction.
Third of these papers; The positions of the member states of the ""Arab Moderation Club"", and it began to appear at the last Cairo meeting. The Palestinians this time, a cause, rights and resistance, are not They are the only ones who are subjected to threats, but rather two basic and founding members in this club .. If he left these two countries vulnerable to pressure without an Arab safety network, all its member states will endanger and threaten, without a guarantee of any kind, that the extortion weapon will not chase everyone If he succeeds in achieving his goals in the narrow link surrounding Palestine.
In this context, it is sufficient for the signed countries to meet the peace treaties and the Abrahamic agreements, in order to come out with a unified voice: ""All these agreements and treaties in the palm and displacement of another palm"", until this project is dropped, and even the Arabs and Palestinians come out of Trump's birth and post -stage War, with a lot of chickpeas, not with empty baskets.
To wave this paper, it is the most active response to the aspiring man to obtain ""Nobel Peace"", even as he proposes a project for Gaza, ensuring that he was transferred to ""The Hague"" on charges of calling for a war crime, and forced displacement by all accounts, a fully description and pillar war.
Fourth of these papers; Working on the ""American interior"", for each country of Arab moderation has its network of relations with personalities, institutions and centers of decision -making in the United States, and it is in general and a tremendous pressure force, The voltage was unified and the move coordinated.
Not all American institutions adopt Trump's policies and attitudes, some of which see a ""raging elephant in the porcelain shop"" .. This is the time to marry the widest internal American front, against this political chaos that leads to escaping from all the value and principle of the values ??and principles of international law, and on These countries are to start from a Muslim that Washington has interests in this region, and with these countries, no less important than The interests of our countries and our countries with the great state in the world.
Fifth of these papers; The European and Umayyad positions, they expressed the shock from the project, and their high circles spoke with the voice of rejection and booing, which are sympathetic positions on global concern about the rise of Trump .. not the United Nations, forget the man his endeavor to marginalize and dry its resources, nor Europe will forget his endeavor to dwarf it, and strike relations between my beaches Atlantic .. Here you can search for a European and international security network, embezzled by legitimacy International, the decisions of international consensus, and the references of the peace process, to highlight the ugly faces, the racism of this project.
Opportunities to create a global, not Arab or regional front, to confront this project, appears to be promising, if moved from Without delay, to save the rights of the Palestinians first, and safeguard the security of the Arab countries targeted by the displacement secondly, this project is not an unnecessary destiny, and Trump is not the total ability, no matter how review Confidence in the ability to defeat this project is the condition of its defeat, and its defeat is possible and impossible.
The opinions in the article do not necessarily reflect the editorial position of Al -Jazeera.",QA
"US President Donald Trump, the Jordanian diplomacy, put face to face, in front of one of its worst nightmares: the great state, and through its newly -elected leader, adopts the thesis of the most extreme Israeli right, to displace the Palestinians from their homes, and solve their national cause outside their homeland, in Jordan and neighboring countries, and on Her account and account of the Palestinians, both.
Since the phone call revealed by the White House yesterday, between US President Donald Trump and Jordanian King Abdullah II, social media, Oman Salons and its political forums have swept a wave that has not been cut off, from comments expressing anxiety and shock, while the question: What is the work? He still hesitates to every tongue, with a lot of frustration and ""weakening of resourcefulness"".
Old - new
The displacement of the Palestinians from their homes is not a new project. Peace, which started more than a third of a century ago, was the ghost of ""displacement"" overlooking his bad head, It was Other ghosts overlook their multiple heads, and ugly, on the Jordanian internal scene: resettlement, alternative homeland, federal and Confederation.
With the spread of the religious and national right on large areas of the Israeli political and party map, in the government and the opposition for twelve years, the attribute of the Jordanian anxiety was continuous For life in the West Bank, Jerusalem and the Strip, which is a work and works, in a systematic systematic way, to destroy the two -state solution, His leaders and pillars declare the need for Israel to ""purify Judea and Samaria"" from its inhabitants (there is no place in their dictionary for something called the West Bank), and slandering them, forcibly and voluntarily outside their country, and the maps that fly from the locations of this current and its media, suggests Jordan's annexation of ""Israel"" Great.
With the beginning of the war of purification, cordonity and extermination launched by Tel Aviv on the Gaza Strip, after the seventh of October and the Flood of Al -Aqsa, the Biden Democratic Administration seemed to approach the most extreme Israeli right project, and its Foreign Minister Anthony Blinkin started promoting an idea The displacement of the Gazans, albeit temporarily, and from a false and exposed humanity, so it was on his first tour of the region after the war, the Messenger of Israel in marketing and justifying this project that is branched from the philosophy of ethnic cleansing, the fascism of style and content.
What was human and temporary with the Democratic administration, will become strategic and sustainable at the Trump administration. A success story in their integration and care .. And when the man was asked about if He was thinking of a temporary or permanent arrangement for these people, he said, ""long -term"", and in the circumstances, the Palestinian -Jordanian -Arab experience, with the occupation entity, does not let any doubt, that every temporary in the Israeli dictionary becomes always, unless Israel is forced into otherwise that.
He increased the level of Jordanian anxiety from the American position that is alienated in its intensity and its audacity to insult the rights of the Palestinians and the security and stability of Egypt and their stability, that its disclosure in the phone call to it, came after only a few days, from the ""executive order"" that his dowry Trump, with his signing, requires ""suspension"" of foreign aid for a period of ninety days, to complete a review of its feasibility and the extent of its corresponding to the new American foreign policy agenda and its priorities .. As the new US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, excluded Israel and Egypt from the list of countries covered by ""comment"", he has lost. It was remarkable that he kept Jordan in it ... ""Poisoned"" to Egypt, and always for the same purpose: passing paid projects from the Palestinian bag and their rights, and the security and stability of the Arabs, in exchange for appealed the right and the occupied entity.
The truth is that we were, before Trump coming to the White House, and his sweeping victory in the last elections, we said that it would be more ""package"" in terms of the ceasefire in Gaza, and more generous in terms of what he could offer to Tel Aviv than Rasha and the progress of that .. But we and the truth are said We did not think that he would do it so quickly, and with this amount of struggle, and that it would start from Gaza, without stopping in the West Bank, He was the one who launched his first term by ""granting"" Israel a third of its area, and all Jerusalem, as the capital of ""eternal and united"" to it, and decided to move his country's embassy from Tel Aviv to it.
Trump's talk and demands (Or its pressure) for the displacement of the people of Gaza to Jordan and Egypt, which gives indicative references to the nature of the ""deal"" that is in its head, to resolve the conflict in the Middle East, and to put out its wars and dimensions ... A deal that may be titled ""The Deal of the 2 Century"", more generous with Jewish and Zionist extremists , And more transgressing and violating Palestinian rights and Arab interests ... a deal that almost adopts the basic components The theory of ""resolving the conflict"" that religious Zionism started before it became the strategy of the Hebrew state and its political institutions.
The observer, with a little bit of prudence and boldness, can conclude from what Trump went in his call yesterday with the king, and today or tomorrow with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al -Sisi, that his administration will not go far in facilitating the relief of Gaza and harboring its homeless, and rebuilding what was destroyed by the armed Israeli war machine The American .. with a weighting, the tried eye does not make it wrong, that these headlines will be transformed The three: (relief, shelter, reconstruction), to light weapons, which Washington is known for the Palestinians, Jordanians and Egyptians, among other weapons that are still hidden in the American Group.
In its first week, this administration has paved more disturbing transformations And the danger of American policy regarding the file of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, as it raised the settlers from the lists of US sanctions, and allowed heavy bombs to be shipped: (a thousand and two thousand lb) to Israel after the Biden administration froze its supply, and Israel excluded the decision to suspend foreign aid, all in within Less than six working days, the rope on the jars.
There is no destiny for him
This does not mean for one moment, that Washington's will is an irreplaceable destiny, and that the Arabs and the Palestinians have left nothing but raising the white flags, in order to avoid the anger of the ""raging elephant in porcelain and glass shop"" .. The Palestinians said their word directly in steadfastness and steadfastness on their land in the full battle of purification. And extermination, and they paid the high prices of their living flesh, and they were the ones who realized their sense and their ""collective"" awareness The Nakba was not in the loss of the land, but rather in the displacement of its residents.
They learned the lesson in the most difficult way, and they are not to forget the lessons of the Nakba, the setback and the defeat. And the Palestinian resistance factions that have written the miracle of the resistance and steadfastness in Gaza, expressed their absolute rejectionist position for purification and displacement projects, and from behind it the Palestinian national consensus stands, and crystallizes.
There is no choice for Jordan and Egypt, Except for resisting this project, if it is not a matter of solidarity with the Palestinian people and their right to their land and homeland, it is a matter of defending their security and stability. In the Egyptian case, the obedience to Washington's dictates and its temptations (its poisoned islands) will receive from the Sadhaqiya of the regime, its popular incubators, and it will be made by national sovereignty, independent decision, and the pioneering and historical role.
In Jordan, the threat exceeds security and stability, to identity and the entity, in other words, if the displacement is a threat to Egypt's security and stability, then in the Jordanian case, an existential threat, to the state, identity, and entitlement, and will lead if it is achieved, to transfer the conflict from being a Palestinian -Israeli, who is the definition. Its limbs and limits, to an internal conflict compound in Jordan, and at its expense.
The Jordanians and the Palestinians, and with them all the right, fear that the plan to displace the sons and daughters of Gaza will be, if today, a ""rehearsal"" of what could happen in the West Bank in the near future, especially with the decision of the Netanyahu government to transfer the war from Gaza, and before that It puts its Ozar to the West Bank, and the transfer of a fetus and its camp to ""mini Gaza"", in the restoration of the war of the war of purification and extermination that was launched on Jabalia Beit Lahia and House Hanoun.
For these reasons, and many others, there is no room for failure or retreat in the battle to drop the displacement project, from any issued party, even if the American president (the strongest) is the one who leads the ranks of the opponents of it and its promoters .. This is not an option at all, and there are power papers. Having the audacity to use it, among them, for example, but not limited to:
Some of us were angry when we went to say: Washington will not hesitate to resolve its options and preferences between Israel and its Arab allies, if it finds itself unable to reconcile their conflicting or contradictory interests .. We said that it will take without hesitation, the side of Israel and will be able to defend it, not in Facing Hamas or the axis of resistance, but also in the face of its Arab allies, and will look at any damage that may be caused by them, from the point of view of the side effects For the disease or medicine “Collateral Damages” .. This happened with Jordan during the time of the first century deal, and it may be repeated with Jordan and Egypt, the time of the “second century deal”, which comes on the road.
The Arabs went to peace with Israel in the hope of providing security and stability. Aviv, especially Washington .. Some thought that treaties and agreements will bring peace of mind, so if the fascist and populist oath, who overlooks his ugly head from the folds of the Netanyahu government and the Trump administration, opens his jaws on their wideness, threatening to eat green and dry, so do we preach, and we return to the wisdom of former Egyptian President Mohamed Hosni Mubarak (late for her time): Covered in America Arian.

"US President Donald Trump's statements made a political earthquake in the region and the world by announcing his desire to control the Gaza Strip and possess it for a long time, with the aim of transferring him to the Middle East ""Riviera"" after the displacement of its residents to ""forever"" to Egypt, Jordan and other countries.
This perception would not have occurred to the minds of politicians and observers, especially after Trump boasted more than once with the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, which is supposed to lead to the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation army from it, and the attempt to build it with the start of the third stage, i.e. about three months later From starting its implementation.
This position brought rejected Palestinian, Arab, especially Egypt, Jordan, international, especially the European Union, Britain, China, Russia, and the Secretary -General of the United Nations Guterres.
President Trump justified the idea of ??displacing Palestinians from Gaza, for humanitarian reasons to provide a safe and generous place for the population outside Gaza, because it is an insecure place.
The irony is that he presented this idea and Netanyahu, who is responsible for the crime of destroying Gaza, which is required to a memorandum brought to the International Criminal Court, as a war criminal because of his killing of the Palestinians and the destruction of the features of their lives in Gaza, stands beside him and smiles A wide smile in a Syrian scene, indicating the level of political cabinet and the value deviation of the guest and the host.
Instead of expiation for the American president about Washington's sin in its absolute support for the occupation and destroying the entire Gaza Strip with American weapons, it is quick to put forward ideas that amount The world's biggest power, their extremist theological beliefs simulate the destruction of the other And its debt, to build an ethnic and religious entity, in a hateful, hateful, hateful image.
It is noteworthy that after a few days of Trump launching the idea of ??displacement of the Palestinians, informed sources spoke to the New York Times that ""senior members of the American administration were shocked"", and that ""the administration did not make basic planning to examine the feasibility of the proposal,"" and Israeli sources indicated that the Israeli security services were surprised Also with this proposal, which indicates that President Trump presented a serious, superficial, superficial idea on The future of the Palestinian issue and the security of the Middle East, without a deep study of the realism of its application.
This prompted Advisers to President Trump to say that ""the idea of ??the ownership of the Gaza Strip will disappear after it became clear to the American president that it is not applicable,"" according to the New York Times, but the question, why did President Trump raised this idea, is it just a supreme thought or are there goals and goals in the mind Trump?
First: It is not excluded that this idea will be a balloon of a test of the reaction of the Palestinians and the Arab countries concerned, so if the positions are different or hesitant and weak, then Trump will advance the idea forward, to serve the occupied Israel by getting rid of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip, and then repeat Experience in the West Bank, to achieve the dream of Israel occupied in controlling the entire historical Palestine without its original residents.
And if this scenario succeeds, it will be an introduction to the Greater Israel, where the eyes of the Zionists are in southern Lebanon, Jordan and southern Syria ... and this spoke to the Minister of Finance in Salail Smotrich, who sees in Jordan a part of the promised land, and as he and the Minister of Communications Shlomo indicated that it is limits Jerusalem arrives in Damascus.
Second: If the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip is a failed idea strategically because it is not realistic, President Trump may use it as a tactical maneuver, by pretending that he will waive or reduce his roof from displacement to accepting the reconstruction of Gaza, to achieve two goals under blackmail and bargaining:
The first goal: pressure to disarm Hamas and the Palestinian resistance, and control the future of the Gaza Strip and manage it with criteria that take into account the security interests of the Israeli occupation, in exchange for its reconstruction.
The second trend: pressure on Saudi Arabia to give up the condition of the Palestinian state, and accepting normalization with occupied Israel in exchange for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, as an urgent Palestinian and Arab need, because the displacement will prepare a recipe for escalation and security turmoil in the region and its countries, especially Egypt, and Jordan.
Third: The displacement from the White House inhabitant, is a grant for Benjamin Netanyahu, to help him stabilize his government, by giving him an opportunity to market the continuation of the implementation of the second stage, from the ceasefire agreement, with his right -wing extremist allies such as the Minister of Finance in Salafel Smotrich, who threatens the collapse of the government if it is done Moving to the second stage, and here the idea of ??displacement of Gaza residents becomes a supposed price, to enforce the ceasefire agreement The fire that Washington sponsored and seen President Trump as an achievement Historical and high -speed.
The idea, although it is imagined or dreamy, becomes an interest that is used for Trump and Netanyahu, each of what it means and follows.
Some Arab countries have stood a faded or inconvenient stance in stopping the genocide that the Gaza Strip was exposed to, stating that the fire will not reach it, and that this ""neutral"" position will bring it the satisfaction of the United States of America, and the repercussions of the catastrophic scene in Gaza.
As for the matter, it went beyond the borders and moved to the security of the Arab countries, as a matter of displacement of the Palestinians, especially the threat of Egyptian national security, and the threat of Jordan's national identity on the base of the alternative homeland for the Palestinians, according to the Israeli vision, the matter has become urgent and necessary to take a firm position and strictly refuse to displace Then the rush to protect the Palestinian presence in Gaza, through relief and reconstruction without delay or procrastination; So that the occupied Israel or President Trump does not remain an argument or an excuse.
Supporting Gaza and supporting the Palestinian people in the face of the Israeli occupation, constitutes immunity for the Palestinian issue, as it is an interest for the Arab countries; The Palestinian steadfastness is a decisive factor for the Israeli occupation of the appetite of the colonial settlement expansion, Israel has the ability to threaten the interests of Arab countries.
The arrogance of the Israeli expansionist power, and the extreme position of President Trump, requires serious and strong Arab positions, especially from Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, especially in light of Trump's reference and American officials, that Arab regimes talk in the media about something and behind the scenes about something else, and this is what makes the Arab position Decisive and historical to protect Arab interests, foremost of which is the interests of countries that have not interfered with them Normalizing its relations with occupied Israel.
The Western system, led by Washington, and President Trump, cannot be appreciated and only respectful, and they only measure matters according to the logic of interests, and this principle must be a standard for the Arab position, which has the papers of political, economic and geographical power that makes the Arab region the heart of the world and the nerve of international trade.
It is sufficient for Egypt and Jordan to loosen their relations and peace agreements with occupied Israel until the latter and Washington re -consider their catastrophic policies on the Palestinian issue and on Arab national security.
The existential repercussions of the Israeli occupation policies, deserve to be a bold steps to raise the roof The politician is in front of everyone who threatens the fate of the region and the fate of the Palestinian issue.
The truth was and will remain that occupied Israel is an absolute evil, and the Zionist project is a strategic threat to the security of the Arab countries and the interests of their peoples, no matter how some people try to tame peace or make concessions.

Everyone is waiting for the details of the Egyptian -Arab joint plan that Egypt and several Arab countries are working on to rebuild Gaza while ensuring that the Palestinian people remain on their land without displacement, in response to the proposals of the American President to displace the Palestinians to Egypt and Jordan and perhaps other countries, and to possess and transfer Gaza for what he called ""Rivera East Middle "".
According to the sources that BBC spoke to them, Cairo is about to end the technical details of the plan, which is concerned with removing the rubble, rebuilding Gaza and defining the way the Palestinians lived in the meantime, but some political points are still incomplete, including the future of armed movements in the sector, especially Hamas and Jihad Islamic.
On Sunday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi stressed the importance of starting the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip without the displacement of its residents, indicating that Egypt is an integrated plan in this regard.
Egypt consults with Arab countries, including Jordan and Saudi Arabia, in the details of the plan in preparation for its presentation at a five -year Arab meeting in Riyadh on February 21st, with the participation of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the Emirates and Qatar, with expectations that other Gulf countries join this Meeting.
A Jordanian official told Reuters that the Riyadh meeting with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will be decisive because it leads the current efforts to reach the appropriate plan.
End proposed stories
This meeting is scheduled to follow an emergency Arab summit that was scheduled at the end of this month, but it may be postponed, according to Ambassador Hossam Zaki, Assistant Secretary -General of the League of Arab States, to discuss developments in the Palestinian issue in light of the ideas of US President Donald Trump.
Reuters said that at least 4 proposals were formulated, but an Egyptian proposal currently appears to be the basis for the Arab endeavor to put an alternative to Trump's idea that can be marketed with him with no exclusion of its name ""Trump's plan"" to win his approval.
Egypt announced that the plan will be in cooperation with the American administration in order to reach a fair settlement of the Palestinian issue that takes into account the rights of the peoples of the region, as Egyptian sources say that there will be a role for the United Nations and the European Union.

It is worth the end
An Egyptian source familiar with the BBC says that there are Arab consultations that have already started to prepare a conference for the reconstruction of Gaza With wide European participation, starting in the first stages of the reconstruction of the sector.
The source adds that the Arab plan is mainly based on the reconstruction of Gaza with the presence of its residents by dividing the sector into three humanitarian areas, each of which has a large camp in which the population resides while providing means of subsistence from water, electricity, and others.
According to the plan, thousands of mobile homes and tents that resemble homes will be entered into safe areas to stay for a period of six months in parallel, with the aggression resulting from the war during the same period, and this is something that the Israelis are not currently permitted in the first stage of the ceasefire.
The plan will also emphasize the need to enter enough goods to Gaza as it was before the war, with fuel and reconstruction mechanisms.
The features of the Egyptian -Arab plan include that reconstruction is conducted with Arab and international funding, with the participation of about 50 multinational companies specialized in the areas of construction, construction and planning to build safe housing units within a year and a half in the three areas of the sector.
An Arab government official in statements to Reuters did not rule out the creation of a fund that might be called the ""Trump Fund for the Reconstruction of"" Gaza "".
The proposal also includes, according to Reuters A barrier to block the drilling of tunnels across the Gaza border with Egypt, then remove the rubble and establish 20 temporary housing areas.
Dr. Tariq Al -Nabrawi, the head of the Egyptian Engineers Syndicate, told the BBC that the union formed a consulting committee on Tuesday to develop a technical strategy for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip at the highest engineering level without the displacement of its people, in cooperation with the Union of Arab Engineers.
Al -Nabrawi explains that the implementation of the plan completely and final may take 3 to 5 years if it meets great support, because it needs the participation of hundreds of companies, engineering offices, and alliances, Egyptian, Arab and international due to the very severe destruction in the sector.
And on the technical stages of this step, Al -Nabrawi explains the need first to remove the rubble and recycle it as part of the concrete for construction or as part of the floors during the construction process, and the start second in extending the infrastructure from water, sanitation, electricity, water desalination plants and communications lines, and finally the sector planning urban Building housing units and various educational, health and cultural services.
In his speech to the BBC, the Egyptian source seeing that the most prominent point has not yet been discussed. It is the issue of the status of members of the Hamas movement and the armament of the movement and other armed movements within the sector.
The source explains that there is a proposal that highlights the willingness of what he called the ""Palestinian Resistance"" to disarm it for the announcement of the establishment of the Palestinian state on the borders of June 4, 1967 and its capital, East Jerusalem, with the establishment of a buffer zone to reassure Israel that there are no threats coming from the Gaza Strip.
According to Reuters, three Egyptian security sources said that the proposal submitted by Cairo includes the formation of a Palestinian committee for the rule of the Gaza Strip without the participation of Hamas, in addition to moving towards a two -state solution.
Sources confirmed to Reuters that forcing Hamas to abandon any role in Gaza will be necessary, with the formation of temporary Arab and international forces to help the Palestinian Authority in the initial management of the sector.
The Cairo news channel, funded by the Egyptian government, quoted an unnamed Egyptian source that Hamas will not be committed to participating in the management of the Gaza Strip in the next stage, with its commitment to the three stages of the ceasefire agreement with Israel, adding that there are extensive Egyptian contacts to form a temporary committee to supervise The ""Relief and Reconstruction of the Strip"" process.
Hamas has previously said She is ready to abandon the rule of Gaza for a national committee, but she wants to have a role in choosing its members and will not accept the deployment of any ground forces without their approval.
Sources who spoke to Reuters believe that the plan is sufficient to change Trump's opinion, and can be imposed on Hamas and the Palestinian Authority led by President Mahmoud Abbas.
Dr. Mubarak Al Aati, a Saudi political science professor, says that the Arab plan must include ending Hamas's individual rule for the Gaza Strip, adding that it is a faction that cannot be completely excluded.
Al -Aati adds that the two sides must be pressured by Hamas and the Palestinian Authority to achieve Palestinian reconciliation and unify the rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The informed Egyptian source confirms that the Arab countries, according to the plan that is crystallizing, will support the Palestinian Authority with everything necessary to train their members in cooperation with the European Union.
Al -Ati believes that the two -state solution is the true deterrent to achieve peace in the region, especially with the Israeli rejection by the Knesset and its voting against the idea of ??establishing the Palestinian state, according to the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, and he adds: The Arab countries must stick to their plan with the two -state solution, especially if the Israeli people abandoned Support The right -wing government of Netanyahu.
Repeated and repeated, US President Donald Trump stated his plan to displace the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, sometimes on the pretext of owning it as a land for tourism investment, and sometimes for the Palestinians themselves who need to live in an unparalleled land like the Gaza Strip, waving the possibility of stopping aid to Egypt and Jordan if they do not receive the Palestinians, Then, retreating from the idea of ??using money as a threat.
Dan Perry, the former Middle East Editor in Cairo and the editor of Europe and Africa at the Associated Press in London, sees to him in the Israeli Jerusalem Post, Trump's plan to displace the Palestinians from Gaza ""ink on paper"", and that its real goal is to force the Arab and Palestinian countries in Gaza On pressure on Hamas and its removal from the sector's rule, the movement's support is financially stopped by the Arab countries, especially Qatar, and the exit offer The final from Gaza on Hamas leaders.
During a meeting in Washington on February 11, the American President Donald Trump and the King of Jordan Abdullah II said, the Jordanian monarch told reporters that he was ""awaiting Egypt's plan on how to work with Trump regarding Gaza's challenges,"" adding that the Arabs will be They provide a response to Trump's plan, and that he intends to hold consultations in Saudi Arabia in this regard.
Then she stated on Wednesday evening, a spokeswoman for US President Caroline Levitte, that the Jordanian monarch, Abdullah II, had made it clear to Trump that he prefers to keep the Palestinians in Gaza during the reconstruction process, while the US President still believes that their output is better and safer for them.
Perry believes that Trump may agree to the Arabs' refusal to displace the Palestinians from Gaza in exchange for providing tens of billion dollars to the reconstruction of Gaza, and their approval to step down Hamas.
The hidden goals of Trump's plan in exchange for the Arab refusal to displace the Palestinians from Gaza may also include, according to Berry, the establishment of a civilian government of technocrats in Gaza, linked to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, and cooperates with Egypt and the Gulf states.
For his part, Dr. Hassan Munimneh, a political analyst from Washington, sees Trump's plan a real desire that has no hidden goals, because he realizes that his image will be threatened if he retracted what he says, he wants to displace the Palestinians from Gaza in order to give it to Israel, and he adds: ""The ball is in a stadium Arabs, they obey or not. ""

Dr. Mubarak Al Aati, Professor of Sciences, says Saudi politics The United States is pressuring but has great interests in the region, especially in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, and Trump must take into account this, adding that the personal relations between the rulers of Egypt, the United States and Saudi Arabia will enable them to find a common ground for consensus, especially in light of Trump's planned visit Saudi Arabia, which will draw Arab -American relations in the coming days.
For his part, Dr. Hassan Munimneh, a political analyst from Washington, sees that the Arabs must deal with a club with Trump's plan by announcing its condemnation before they refused to displace the Palestinians from Gaza, because Trump uses the logic of power in his decisions, and if he sees from before him he negotiates and replaces, he will conclude that he is a weak and pumping party .
Munimna adds that if Trump cuts military and economic aid from Egypt and Jordan to reject the Arab plan, the two countries must have Arab support in return, and Riyadh prevent its investments in the United States, and that the Arab countries open an economic communication with China, Russia, the European Union, Africa and South America.
The Al -Ati drew attention to the strength of Saudi Arabia's normalization paper, its relations with Israel and widening it, where it was announced Riyadh in response to Trump linked normalization with Israel to the establishment of a Palestinian state at the limits of 1967, and Al -Ati adds that Saudi Arabia's political, religious and economic weight is imperative to take into account its interests towards the Palestinian issue, which is the only remaining sword for the Arabs to provide it in defense.
The Egyptian source, who declined to be called, believes that Cairo's hinting of the abolition of the peace treaty with Israel (Camp David) signed in 1979 is a strong paper in the face of Washington in the event that Trump rejects the Arab plan.",UK
"President Trump declared his vision to resolve the humanitarian catastrophe caused by the Israeli occupation in the Gaza Strip, by displacing the Palestinians (2.25 million or most of them) to Jordan, Egypt and other Arab countries, to relieve them and provide them with life ingredients as a step that could be ""long -term"", confirming his contact with the Jordanian King Abdullah The second, and his intention to contact Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al -Sisi, and he had already spoke to him after that.
The seriousness of this position in terms of form is that it comes out of the head of the largest country in the world, influencing international politics and the Middle East, and a head of state claiming democracy and human rights and respect for the will of peoples, and gives itself ""civil"" to be a policeman to protect international law, peace and security!
President Trump's position, of course, intersects with the position and vision of the extreme Zionist right in occupied Israel, which is clearly expressed by the resigned national security minister, Itamar bin Ghafir, who is a candidate in Trump's statements, and the Minister of Finance in Salafel Smotic, who considered Trump's position great and thinking from outside the fund, expressing his keenness to implement the idea With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
President Trump's invitation to displace the Palestinians from a sector Gaza, cast a serious and political shadow and repercussions, including:
This position constitutes a position for the occupied State of Israel and not only a position for the government of the extreme right. The Israeli Knesset/ the Israeli parliament adopted legislation (basic law), known as the Jewish National Law issued in 2018, the Palestinians are considered a minority and not a people or nationalism, and they are not entitled to self -determination. A time when settlement in the West Bank is supported as a national value.
There are important challenges standing in front of this hypothesis, namely:
This is what he confirmed, in response to the invitation of President Trump, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Al -Safadi, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry’s statement, and the position of President Abdel Fattah Al -Sisi, who described Trump's proposal as “an injustice that Egypt cannot participate in,” stressing that the displacement of the Palestinians ”will negatively affect national security Al -Masry and Al -Arabi.
In this context, it must be noted that the displacement of the Palestinians will take with it the continuation of their resistance to the Israeli occupation from outside the historic borders of Palestine from the neighboring Arab countries, which is what Cairo and Amman do not want, which have peace agreements with Israel, and this will be created, if there is an assumption, a crisis Between the Palestinians and Egypt And Jordan, of course, will affect the peace agreements with Israel, which President Sisi referred to in mid -October 2023, immediately after the Battle of the Flood of Al -Aqsa, in response to the efforts of US Secretary of State Blinkin, at the time, to displace the Palestinians from Gaza.
So the rejection of the displacement in it is a common Palestinian and Arab interest; It protects the Palestinian issue and the right of the Palestinians in an independent state, and it constitutes a protection for the Egyptian, Jordanian and Arab national security, and it curbs Israel's appetite to expand towards Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt according to the vision of the extreme Zionist right that promotes the idea of ??the promised land and Greater Israel.
In connection with this, the role of the Arab countries, especially Egypt and Jordan, becomes necessary and urgent to implement the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, and then to introduce relief aid, and the initiative urgently to hold an Arab and Islamic summit to discuss the Gaza reconstruction file to ensure the stability of the Palestinian presence, and withdraw the pretext from before Netanyahu. The extremist right and President Trump, who justify the idea of ??displacement with ""human"" excuses A pioneer, and in fact it has no relationship to humanity, as much as it is a political goal to enable Israel to include the West Bank Western occupation of Gaza, Judaizing Jerusalem and the blessed Al -Aqsa Mosque.

"It is not an idea of ??the mood and improvisation that launched by US President Donald Trump about the displacement of the Palestinians of the Gaza Strip and their dispersal between Egypt and Jordan, or in other countries, with the aim of ""making them happy"" and removing them from the state of ruin and misery. Trump's saying falls in the context of an American strategy aged from the age of the Nakba, and its pioneer, President Harry Truman. Before talking about Trump, the displacement and what preceded it, it is okay to restore an article by Yossi Melman, published in the Hebrew newspaper Haaretz (11/20/2023), about the concept of ""Essaad"" The Palestinian displaced in their exile, according to the vision of Tudor Herzl, who does not turn away Annoy on Trump's ""Establishment"" theory. Before the Basel Conference in two years, that is, in 1895, specifically in June, Herzl wrote: “The lands allocated to us must take them from their owners gradually. We will move the poor out of our state and work to provide work for them in the countries to which they will move, and remove the poor from our state. To be cautious and calm. ”Where can the Palestinians be displaced? Once the first president of Israel, Haim Weizmann. According to the Jordanian newspaper Al -Jazeera (27/4/1949), Weizmann told reporters after his meeting US President Harry Truman: ""He suggests housing refugees from the Arabs of Palestine in the Tigris Valley and the Euphrates, and this is the best place that is suitable for that, because it is desirable and abundant water, and where Adam and Eve lived."" This proposal, which Weizmann presented to President Truman, is drawn from the Old Testament, as there are biblical interpretations of the place of Adam and Eve's landing from Paradise, that he is in the land of Iraq, or between the latter and Syria, in the island region. And it was mentioned in the training of training: “When the Lord created the God of the Earth and the heavens, he instilled a paradise in Aden in the east, and he lived there, Adam, and he was coming out of Aden a river and he will water heaven, and he was broken from there, and four rivers become one of them, one of which is Fishon, the second Jihon, the third is the Tigris, and the fourth is the Euphrates, And the Lord God took Adam and inhabited the Paradise of Aden, and the Lord God said it is not good to be Adam alone, and what He was asleep, he took one of his ribs, created a woman from the rib that he took from Adam, and Adam called his wife Eve because she is the mother of every neighborhood.

Trump's idea of ??the displacement of Palestinians falls in the context of an American strategy of the age of the Nakba, and its pioneer Truman
In the Bible dictionary, which I supervised his Arabization and preparation for a group of great theologians and historians, as the site of ""the paradise of Aden is not unanimous, some of whom considers Armenia as Aden, and there are those who see that the Aden River is only the Euphrates River - Tigris, which is in the Shatt al -Arab, the Eden Baghdad, according to their opinion , It is the southern part of Iraq, and it is believed to be the closest place to the right. "" Returning to Al -Jazeera newspaper, especially its numbers in June 1949, the proposals of the settlers of the Palestinians on the Syrian island or in Iraq can be followed. And Iraq is less than their population. The next day, I wrote in a cynical and objectionable language: ""It came from London that the diplomatic offices (correspondent) for the Times newspaper held a major article on the refugee issue in which he referred to their housing projects in Syria and Iraq, and the US State Department donated by sending one of its experts to study housing projects Refugees in Syria and Iraq. Syrian President Hosni Al -Zaeem agrees in principle on The resettlement of the Palestinians in Syria, and from what I mentioned: ""The leader of the leader talked about the Palestinian refugees, so he said if international conditions are required to keep them in our country, so we will open in their face the Al -Jazeera region, which is one of the most fertile agricultural areas in Syria, and we will prepare large agricultural and industrial projects that open in their faces to live and work."" On August 4 of the same year, Al -Jazeera quoted a source Reliable, ""The US government proposed to the Arab countries to distribute 500,000 Palestinian refugees among them. On the fifth of the month, it published a shocking news, its shape and content in this aspect, ""It was known that a number of Arab refugees in Egypt have informed the League of Arab States of their desire to travel to Syria, where the Syrian government distributes lands to the refugees who were deprived of their properties in Palestine."" Muhammad Jamal Barrot, in a high -value book, issued by the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies (2013), entitled ""The modern historical formation of the Syrian island:"" Since 1909, the Syrian island, until the first months of 1948, has been subject to the ambitions of the Zionist movement and its national fund in investment and building Jewish settlements in it, or transferring them To a shelter to accommodate Palestinian farmers, and after Israel, its government turned a blind eye to the settlement project, but the administration of President Harry Truman carried it with a kind of ideological and practical euphoria, to become a project to resettle Palestinian refugees in the Arab countries and in the island in particular, an American project, and this project will explain an essential part From the story of most of the Syrian military coups from 1949, until 1954.
According to Jamal Barrot, the Syrian island has since 1909 was subject to the ambitions of the Zionist movement in investment and the construction of Jewish settlements in it, or to convert them to accommodate the Palestinian farmers.
According to Jamal Barrot, the Syrian island has since 1909 was subject to the ambitions of the Zionist movement in investment and the construction of Jewish settlements in it, or to convert them to accommodate the Palestinian farmers.
In the details of these projects, the Israeli committee for the deportation of the Arab population from Palestine, in 1937, suggested that a member of it be sent to the Syrian island to conduct an investigation into it, and in another meeting in the same year, opinions emerged about the deportation of the Palestinians to Jordan, Syria or Iraq. During the Second World War, the committee was chanted towards two destinations For deportation, Syria and Iraq. In 1941, the director of the Israeli Land Development Authority, Youssef Fayets, on the Syrian island, toured, and wrote a report on the possibility of resettlement of a million people in it, and after the 1948 war, the deportation committee, which was formed by the Israeli government, adopted a project in which it saw a complete ability to both Syria and Iraq to absorb the Palestinian refugees. In fact, the United States adopted the general lines of this report, presented to the Syrian government, and on April 28 1949, the American ambassador in Syria informed his administration that Damascus was considering resettling 250,000 Palestinians in the Al -Jazeera region, while the number of refugees in Syria at the time was only about 80,000. On this project, Prince Adel Arslan wrote in his memoirs: ""Truman says that he will make between the two rivers a paradise, Truman does not know the two rivers or what is between them, Truman and the people of Truman want to transfer every refugee from Palestine to the island, and to become a plantation, and if they are transferred to the island And the Euphrates Valley forgot Palestine. “The United States did not fill the curtain on its project. Refugees in Syria and Iraq, at a cost of $ 250 million, But the project was failed, and then he declined since the mid -fifties of the twentieth century, to overpower his head again with President Joe Biden, who said, after his participation in the Hanuka Day (12/13/2023), he asked Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al -Sisi to open the Rafah crossing to facilitate The crossing of the Palestinians of Gaza to Egypt. Donald Trump does not invent or invent, that he completes the path of his predecessors.",UK
"The Arabs must raise the level and accelerate the political move through a collective Arab pole movement, and hold an immediate Arab summit in attendance or electronically to issue a statement and a streated position on the issue of displacement of the Palestinians.
Since my first article published about Donald Trump's proposal to accommodate Jordan and Egypt to more Palestinians, the American president adds the oil to the fire, and Yabur and expands his strange proposal. He stated that he wants to evacuate the Gaza Strip from all Palestinians and not part of them, and in a final and no return, before the official spokeswoman clarified that what is meant is the temporary displacement.
The truth is that Trump was sincere in what he said, because his purpose is to evacuate the sector from its residents totally, ignoring and not concerned that the Palestinian people have the right to life on their home and in their homeland, and that the world seeks to a solution to the Palestinian -Israeli conflict by enabling the two peoples to live in peace in independent countries And it is not the liquidation of a people in the interest of the other, and the official American politeness was only for the purpose of avoiding Jazjah, which opposes the proposal with international law explicitly, as the Nuremberg Court was considered the problem An American after World War II, forced displacement and genocide is an explicit violation of international law and a crime against Humanity.
Trump expanded the proposal to accommodate two states for the Palestinians, which might suggest that it is a limited temporary process, and to remain unlawful, developed that the deportation may be to about 10 countries from within and outside the Middle East, confirming his desire to eliminate the pressing Palestinian human element, and in line with the direction The Israeli by preserving the Greater Israel of the Jews.
In an additional development, Trump explained that the United States will own the Gaza Strip after emptying its inhabitants, which is a strange and free position on any political or legal basis, because this is supposed to receive the United States illegally the land from the Israeli occupation state, to become America is the occupying power, where There is no authority, government, or Palestinian political trend that is consistent with the proposal and agree or is able to deliver the land to non -Palestinians.
Trump explained that the project will not be implemented with American funds, but rather with Arab funding, and the American military forces will not use, although it is inspired by imagination to leave a Palestinian people who have struggled for more than 70 years under occupation to protect its land, or that the Arabs are ready to finance the liquidation of the Palestinian issue and continue the occupation Under an American cover.
In response to a question About what is reported about the development of the American position on recognition of Israel's annexation of the West Bank of the Jordan River, Trump indicated that he will take a decision in this regard in the coming weeks, which is another dangerous indication that his position on the displacement of the Palestinian people from the Strip is not separate from a broader move and plan on the conflict Palestinian - Israel His election and the positions of the American President attract the international community even before he took power, but rather the reaction to his proposal to Gaza exceeded concerns about his positions on Panama, Greenland, Canada, Mexico and others, and all reactions were without exception except for Israel against the proposal for displacement, including America's allies in the West .
Trump's proposal about Gaza eliminates the entire Palestinian issue and exceeds the Gaza Strip square, and affects the national security of Jordan and Egypt directly, in addition to the security and interests of various Arab countries, as it will enter the Middle East again in an episode of anger and rejection and will create geopolitical sensitivities in its international relations. And the proposal is a risk that imposes on everyone to move in a way The strongest, most comprehensive, deeper and unconventional Arab, regionally and internationally.
The Palestinians are required to reunite and speak with one voice, regardless of their ideological differences, because their issue is on the outskirts of no return and the position of importance and danger greatly exceeds ideological differences or any competition about power and positions, and it is required immediately to form a joint Palestinian government.
Arab is required by Jordan and Egypt to prepare for specific political, security and economic measures if the proposal is attempted, as Trump is expected to exercise more pressure on them in this regard. Abraham's ""Abraham Agreements"" countries are required to take positions expressing their support for the Palestinian issue and the need to adhere to them.
There must be a wide and practical Arab fortification for the Palestinians and the Egyptian and Jordanian position that reject the displacement, by issuing clear and conclusive Arab national statements, as was issued by the Arab neighborhood countries, Egypt, Jordan and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, confirming the American proposal's rejection of form and subject, and that the pursuit of Arab -Israeli peace, which It was repeatedly confirmed, especially at the 2002 Beirut summit, subject to the solution of the Palestinian issue and the Israeli occupation of Arab lands, The situation must be clear and conclusive that the Arab world rejects all rejection to liquidate the Palestinian issue and the American position.
The Arabs must raise the level and accelerate the political move through a collective Arab pole movement, and hold an immediate Arab summit in attendance or electronically to issue a statement and a definitive position on this issue. We must witness a collective Arab move by a number of heads of member states, the six -party Arab Committee concerned with the Palestinian issue, which includes an interview request with the American president to clarify the Arab position, address and attend a meeting of the Security Council and present a position, adhere to the content of the Beirut summit on the Palestinian issue and that a comprehensive peace in exchange for preserving the issue Palestinian, and rejects the idea of ??displacement.
In addition to that, the foreign ministers of the Arab group are required to make quick visits and contacts with the rest of the permanent members of the Security Council and communicate with the various regional groups, confirming the rejection of the American proposal and the purpose of pushing a strong position in the Security Council, especially from the permanent members of the members even if it is faced by an American veto, and I register here The permanent organic countries should take more serious positions than their international responsibilities.
As on the group The Arab itself is to move quickly internationally and progress in the decision of the United Nations General Assembly to prove the international political rejection of any attempt to displace the Palestinian people or to liquidate the issue at their expense, and to call for political and legal action to implement these proposals and establish their illegitimacy.
In parallel with this, we have to carry out an international humanitarian campaign to condemn Israeli practices and mention the danger of the Termbi offering, and also by expediting the provision of necessary and urgent humanitarian assistance in order to facilitate the life of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, and I know that Egypt is in the process of organizing an international conference for this purpose.
I agree with those who see that these steps are insufficient, but I hope that it will contribute and others to amputating the proposal that aims to eliminate the Palestinian issue totally, which was stated by the Israeli government ministers, a position that imposes on us as Arabs and the international community a serious pause, in order to preserve the rights of the Palestinians and stability The Middle East, because the alternative is very dangerous to all of us, but rather on the entire international community, because overcoming international law and giving priority to the law of force on the power of law will touch all of Without exception.

The Arabs must raise the level and accelerate the political move from During a collective Arab Qumami movement, and an immediate Arab summit was held in attendance or electronically to issue a statement and a conclusive position on the issue of displacement of Palestinians.
Since my first article published about Donald Trump's proposal to accommodate Jordan and Egypt to more Palestinians, the American president adds the oil to the fire, and Yabur and expands his strange proposal. He stated that he wants to evacuate the Gaza Strip from all Palestinians and not part of them, and in a final and no return, before the official spokeswoman clarified that what is meant is the temporary displacement.
The truth is that Trump was sincere in what he said, because his purpose is to evacuate the sector from its residents totally, ignoring and not concerned that the Palestinian people have the right to life on their home and in their homeland, and that the world seeks to a solution to the Palestinian -Israeli conflict by enabling the two peoples to live in peace in independent countries And it is not the liquidation of a people in the interest of the other, and the official American politeness was only for the purpose of avoiding Jazjah, which opposes the proposal with international law explicitly, as the Nuremberg Court was considered the problem An American, after World War II, forced displacement and genocide is an explicit violation of international law and a crime against humanity.
Trump expanded the proposal to absorb two states For the Palestinians, what may suggest that it is a limited, temporary process, and to remain unlawful, that the deportation may be to about 10 countries from within and outside the Middle East, in confirmation of his desire to eliminate the pressing Palestinian human element, and in line with the Israeli orientation to preserve the Greater Israel to the Jews .

In response to a question about what is reported about the development of the American position on recognition By joining the West Bank of the Jordan River, Trump indicated that it will take a decision in this regard in the coming weeks, which is another danger indication that his position on the displacement of the Palestinian people from the Strip is not separate from a broader move and plan on the Palestinian -Israeli conflict, and that there are additional steps that require The displacement of the Palestinians in order to preserve the Jewish identity of the Greater Israel, and the target here is explicitly Jordan since its election and the positions of the American president attracting the international community even Before assuming power, but the reaction to his proposal to Gaza exceeded fears about his positions on Panama, Greenland, Canada, Mexico and others, and all reactions were without exception except Israel against the proposal for displacement, including America's allies in the West.

"Six Arab countries confirmed during a meeting held in Cairo on the first of February, their rejection of theses and projects aimed at ""displacing the Palestinians"" outside their lands and under any circumstance.
The meeting of the foreign ministers of Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the State of Qatar, the Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the Secretary -General of the League of Arab States, in response to the invitation of US President Donald Trump to displace the population of the Palestinian Gaza Strip to Egypt, And Jordan.
In a clear message from the six Arab countries, the declared statement at the conclusion of the Cairo administration’s meeting urged the Trump administration to seek to achieve the final solution to the Palestinian issue and the Arab -Israeli conflict according to the principle of the “two -state solution” through which permanent and fair peace in the Middle East can be achieved.
The topic of the call to ""displace the Palestinians"" is not new in the record of the struggle that extends for more than seven decades between the Arab-Palestinian and Israel side; Which occupies all Palestinian territories, the Golan Heights, Jabal Al -Sheikh, and many other regions of Syria.
Since 1948 and attempts to displace Palestinians from their lands, both by a state The occupation, or by other continuous countries, and each stage of the conflict was targeting the Palestinian presence on its soil, and was framework for facades that created the means of international and regional presence in the media and political; Sometimes the requests for displacement are security or political motives, or others, and always the Palestinian, Arab and international position was rejection.
Despite Israel's attempts during the 1948 war, about 750,000 Palestinians of their homes were displaced as a result of the military operations of the gangs associated with the Zionist movement at the time, which caused the destruction of hundreds of Palestinian villages and forced its people to displace them, and since that date the issue of Palestinian refugees was a major humanitarian humanitarian problem that the international community rejected, despite pressure Which was practiced by leaders of the Zionist movement at the time because the Palestinian refugees did not return To their homes, the United Nations issued Resolution 194, which affirms the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes, which has not yet been implemented.
After the six -day war in 1967, in which Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, it led to the displacement of about 245,000 Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip to Jordan, and towards 11 thousand from the Gaza Strip to Egypt, and 116 thousand Palestinians and Syrians from the Golan Heights to Syria, as these countries constitute a geographical extension of the aforementioned areas.
In the eighties of the last century, and during the first Palestinian uprising (1987-1993), calls from some Israeli politicians to displace the Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip appeared, one of the most prominent advocates of that Israeli politician Rehavam Zeevi, who proposed the ""deportation"" of the Palestinians to other Arab countries .
These calls faced widespread criticism from the international community, and were rejected by the Arab countries. Then the Oslo agreements signed on September 13, 1993 came to confirm the necessity of resolving the Palestinian issue through negotiations and not through ""displacement"".
The Arab Summit in Beirut in 2002 adopted the Arab Peace Initiative, which was presented by the late Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, when he was the crown prince, which guarantees the achievement of peace in the Middle East between Israel and the Palestinians on the basis of the establishment of an internationally recognized Palestinian state on the 1967 borders. And the return of refugees and withdrawing from the occupied Syrian Golan Heights, in exchange for recognition and normalization Relations between all Arab countries with Israel.
The Israeli response to this initiative in the tongue of Ariel Sharon, the then Israeli Prime Minister, was to reject the proposal categorically on the basis that it requires Israel to accept a large number of Palestinian refugees, and that it exceeds the Israeli ""red lines"".
The issue of forced displacement of the Palestinians from their homes and homeland has extended from 1948 until today; Displacement calls are often issued by Israeli and American politicians.
Although the Palestinian refugees enjoy the right to return to their homes from which they were displaced under Resolution 194 issued by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, as well Refugee conditions in 1951, the occupying country completely ignores all of this Its dealings of the Palestinian people, and always seeks to achieve its goal to evacuate the land of Palestine from the Palestinians.
US President Donald Trump, in his first term 2017-2021 What was called the ""Deal of the Century"", but this was not achieved during his first age.
But the 15 -month war of Gaza put this issue in its priorities for the current presidential period, so he launched its proposal to transfer the Palestinians from Gaza and the occupied West Bank to Egypt and the neighboring Jordan under any circumstance Its accredited all over the world between countries.
This requires the response of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al -Sisi and the Jordanian monarch Abdullah bin Al -Hussein, where the Egyptian President said during a joint press conference with his guest, Kenyan President William Roto: ""Egypt will not participate in the displacement of the Palestinian people as"" historical injustice, and added: ""It is not possible to leniency Or allow the displacement of the Palestinians due to its impact on the Egyptian national security and Arab national security, ""noting that"" what happened since the seventh of October, until Now it is the result of the repercussions of not reaching the solution of the Palestinian issue. ""
In turn, Jordan affirmed, through its foreign minister, Ayman Al -Safadi, that ""Jordan's position on the displacement of the Palestinians"" is not changing and necessary to achieve stability and peace. What we all want.
US President Donald Trump may go to the threat of economic sanctions against the countries that reject its proposal, especially Egypt and Jordan, which suffer from difficult economic conditions, but the strength of the position of allied countries of Washington, led by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey, will keep the doors of dialogue and communication open With the White House.
Consequently, the language of interests, if it is better to use, with all international demands supporting the solution of the Arab -Israeli conflict through the portal (two -state solution) can give Trump a better vision to retract his proposal and replace it at the invitation of an international conference to rebuild Gaza.
The positions of the Arab countries rejecting the idea of ??displacing the Palestinians proposed by US President Donald Trump on the displacement of the people of the Gaza Strip to Egypt and Jordan, indicating the unity of this position based on legal, political and academic references, and also confirms that the solution of the Palestinian issue must take place through negotiations, and according to decisions International, while respecting the right of the Palestinians to return and live on their soil, and this position has reached completely clearly to the White House, and to the Prime Minister of the occupation state, Benjamin Netanyahu.
It is also remarkable in the Arab position that some Arab countries that are not printed with Israel offered the establishment of a Palestinian state in exchange for normalization with it, such as Algeria, for example, whose president, Abdul Majeed Taboun, said: His country is ready to normalize its relations with Israel on the day when a full Palestinian state is establishing.
While the chances of normalization between Riyadh and Tel Aviv, which Trump sought in his first term, decreases for not achieving what the Kingdom requested regarding the two -state solution and the return of Palestinian refugees to their homes.
The Arab position is pushing two directions: the first rejects the issue of displacing the Palestinians categorically, and the second is to open the prospects for peace and global and regional peace through the establishment of a Palestinian state over its entire soil with the limits of the six -day war in 1967, and a full Arab normalization with Israel.

In the presentation of the newspapers today, we read an article from the Guardian newspaper about the ""impossible option"" that the Arab countries face before the plan of US President Donald Trump on Gaza, and an article from the Israeli newspaper Haaretz about the importance of the current moment for Israel to put a two -state solution on the table, in addition to a third article of The New York Times looks forward to the prospects for a possible visit to US President Trump to China under the ""trade war"" between The two countries.
We start our tour of the Guardian newspaper, where Nisreen Malik wrote an article in which he discusses the options of Arab countries in facing the Trump plan on Gaza, and the ability of these countries to maneuver in order to avoid direct confrontation with the administration of the American President, and at the same time, avoid engaging in his plan on the Gaza Strip.
The writer reviews a number of Arab countries ’positions, and refers to the visit of the Jordanian King Abdullah to Washington, and she says that King Abdullah wanted to reconcile"" staying alongside Trump, and at the same time, the lack of approval of his plan for ethnic cleansing in Gaza, ""as she put it .
The owner of the Egyptian position, which is leaks that talked about the refusal of Egyptian President Abdel Al -Fattah Al -Sisi invited the visit to Washington as long as the issue of ""displacement of Gaza residents"" is on the agenda.
The writer also indicates Saudi Arabia's rejection of Trump's plan, and the Arab leaders ""Jadin"" seeking to coordinate their responses to the plan at an emergency summit that will be held in Saudi Arabia next Thursday.

Malik believes that these positions show the difficulty facing Trump in obtaining the approval of ""even his closest allies"", but they see that there is no Arab consensus on Trump's plan on Gaza, or how to respond to it, as these Arab countries, in the opinion of the writer, constitute a political bloc. , But it has different interests, and it ""will face difficulty in responding to the plan, without falling in Saddam with Trump, or the Arab public, or international public opinion about the lack of The legitimacy of the plan, ""as she put it.
The writer says that the need is now urgent to reach a joint strategy ""on behalf of the Arab countries"", but it emphasizes the difficulty of the task, which is to ""please Trump and reject his plan on Gaza"", in her opinion, two things that cannot be reconciled.

She adds: ""Who It is impossible for the Arab countries to deal with Israel and the United States on Gaza and Palestine, in one way or another, without retreating from a big thing.
Speaking of the difficult options facing Arab countries in dealing with the Trump plan, especially Egypt and Jordan, Malik says that Egypt and Jordan will be the most affected by any resettlement campaign for the Palestinians, due to their geographical proximity. They are also ""senior beneficiaries of US foreign aid"", and she adds: ""The loss of American aid will not only weaken the economies of Jordan and Egypt, but will also weaken their armies and security services and their ability to achieve political stability.""
However, on the other hand, the approval of the Trump plan will turn these countries to ""parties while it will be a broader struggle between Israel and Palestine,"" in the words of the author, who adds: ""Instead of being removing the Palestinians from Gaza, an end to something, it will be the beginning of something else ""It is not safe to assume that the mass displacement of the Palestinians will not lead to an explosion of anything.""
The writer adds that accepting Trump's plan means the transformation of these countries into subsidiary countries and attracting new internal challenges. The Trump challenge, It calls for ""the reshaping of the political scene in the region in an unimaginable way.""
Malik concludes its article by saying that the Arab political elites find itself in this situation because of its ""historical weakness in relation to Palestine"", and that the future of Gaza ""is no longer an issue that can be dealt with with an indefinite preservation of water"", Trump's plan is ""the final erosion gate for safety And the sovereignty of the Middle East, ""the writer said.

In the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, we read an article by writer Jeremy Yiskarov, in which he discusses the importance of offering a two -state solution at this time for Israel, to take advantage of its ""military achievements during the past months.""
The writer says that the war brought with it a ""better, strategic reality for Israel"", as Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis were significantly weakened, and the Assad regime collapsed in Syria, and that Iran's ability to undermine the moderation in the region has shrunk significantly. "" It is necessary for Israel to adopt a comprehensive strategy to take these achievements into consideration. ""
Yuskarov says that the ""endless"" war would endanger any opportunity to reach a political settlement with the Palestinians, as well. For any possibility to establish a broader regional alliance to address the ""escalating Iranian nuclear threat"".
The writer notes that before the October 7 attack, there was no serious momentum to promote the two -state solution or any other solution to the Israeli -Palestinian conflict, and Israel relied on managing the conflict in a way that ""strengthened Hamas's power and weakened any alternative Palestinian leadership.""
The writer believes that this approach to the management of the conflict has killed 1835 Israelis, took more than 250 hostages by Hamas, a great destruction of cities and villages on the border with Gaza and in the north, and tens of thousands of Israeli displaced.
""We need to return all the hostages in one comprehensive deal and end this war, and we have to engage in the process of strenuous reassessment of how to resolve the conflict with the Palestinians in the end. Israel's security will not be served by the delusional victory, or the increase in the pain and suffering of the Palestinians , Or continuing the repressive occupation, ""as he put it.
The writer stresses that the two -state solution is now a ""strategic necessity"", as this path is vital to normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia, and vital to the reconstruction of Gaza and achieving stability in the West Bank, and that it is also that The two -state solution, in the opinion of the writer, may be the key to an important and unprecedented regional opportunity.
The writer concludes by saying that Israel should take the initiative, ""instead of allowing US President Donald Trump's controversial ideas to pave the way"", and that preserving Israel's national security ""must remain in the hands of Israel, and to be linked to the chances of the new strategic reality arising in the region.""
In the New York Times, we read an article by writer Bonnie Glaser asking about the gains that the United States can achieve from any expected visit to Trump to China.
The writer touches on President Trump's intention to visit China during the first 100 days of his presidency. And you see that the visit should focus on addressing specific economic and security issues instead of seeking a comprehensive deal that includes all issues.
Glaser notes that China is facing many economic challenges, which may ""give Trump some benefit, but not to the extent expected."" Chinese President Xi Jinping is likely to avoid imposing more customs recognition of Chinese goods, maintaining a permanent situation of trade between the two countries, and alleviating restrictions on access to American technology. in In exchange, China may expose its purchases of American goods, investments, and cooperation in issues such as Ukraine.
The writer believes that Trump must ""push towards a more fair trade with China"", enhance Chinese investment in the United States, transparently over nuclear weapons, in addition to insisting on demanding China ""to stop supporting the Russian defense industry, which ignites the war in Ukraine and pose a threat Long -term for European security and Atlantic crossing, ""as she put it.
The author concludes by saying that the strategic competition between the United States and China will continue, but the meeting between the American and Chinese president represents an opportunity to secure a ""more fair relationship"".",UK

We start our tour for this day from the British Guardian newspaper, and an article entitled ""Do not make mistakes: the Israeli extremist right is planning for Gaza without Palestinians,"" written by Bin Reef.
The writer begins to refer to the ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian Hamas movement, which entered his second week, pointing to some of the obstacles that faced the agreement, but it was resolved quickly. Then he moves to the future of the agreement, which he sees as a great exhibition.
He wrote: ""There should not be illusions about the direction to which this deal is heading. The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, does not intend to see the matter to a permanent ceasefire, and Netanyahu does not intend to completely withdraw the Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, and will not prevent him Donald Trump - whom many rushed to the credit rates to force Netanyahu to agree to the ceasefire in the first place - from Sleep. ""
The writer charged Netanyahu that he deliberately obstructed the ceasefire negotiations in Gaza over the past year, and leaked secret information from the talks to the press, and the mini security cabinet exceeded to restrict the powers of Israeli negotiators, according to banner.
The writer also said that the Israeli Prime Minister retracted the agreements reached during the cabinet meetings, and invaded the last civil stronghold in Gaza - the city of Rafah, when the deal was on the table, and worked to amplify the gaps between the positions of Israel and Hamas, and add ""red lines"" Arbitrationly new after Hamas accepted the previous conditions of Israel, according to his opinion.
End proposed stories
He wrote: ""Now that Netanyahu finally agreed to the ceasefire - whether due to the pressure from Trump or his own political accounts - the families of the Israeli hostages fear that Netanyahu will give up their loved ones to resume the war.""
The writer believes that the hostages of the hostages have a good reason for that fear, pointing to reports that cast a shadow of Netanyahu's commitment to the complete investigation of the ceasefire.

""It seems that the Prime Minister agreed to the demand of the extremist Israeli Finance Minister, in Salail Smotrich, to resume the fighting after the expiration of the first phase of the three ceasefire stages. Although Netanyahu refrained from admitting this Publicly, however, the sources present in these discussions, and the journalists close to Netanyahu, also confirmed that the chances of the deal reaching its second stage are approaching zero.
Recent opinion polls indicate that Netanyahu will face difficulty in returning to power if the elections were held today, according to the writer, ""Therefore, his political survival - and his ability to prevent the completion of his trial on charges of corruption and accountability for potential failures in the period before the attack of October 7 - It is now in the hands of a man whose vision of Gaza is summarized in permanent Israeli control and the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians. Smotrich.
The writer believes that the vision of Smotrich is in line with the vision of the new US President Donald Trump, who recently spoke to reporters about the idea of ??transferring the residents of Gaza permanently to Egypt or Jordan.
The writer quotes senior Israeli officials that this was not a tongue. Pointing out that ""some in the Netanyahu government view the idea positively, and a transitional official has already presented the possibility of temporarily transferring people from Gaza to Indonesia.""
The writer said that Netanyahu himself claims that he had received assurances from Trump and Joe Biden That the United States will give Israel its full support to resume its attack on Gaza, if negotiations collapsed before the second stage of the agreement.
He concluded: ""Last week, Netanyahu retracted his government's commitment to withdrawing its forces from Lebanon within 60 days (according to the agreement between the two countries), although he blamed Lebanon. It seems that nothing prevents him from doing the same, or what is worse In Gaza. In fact, the consequences of this will be destroyed, for a Palestinian two million, who have just begun to gather the fragments of their broken lives.

We move to the Palestinian newspaper Al -Quds, which also dealt with Trump's statements, and an article entitled ""Trump, displacement and the worst coming"", written by Muhammad Joudeh.
The writer believes that the statements of US President Donald Trump about the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Egypt and Jordan were not pure coincidence or just empty and absurd statements or a tongue.
The writer believes that these statements have what beyond them, considering that they are ""an introduction to seizing the sector by looking at him as a contractor, and as an economic and investment project.""
He wrote: ""In my estimation, too, this trend was revealed by Wiklex leaks while The US Vice President, JD Verse, conveyed, when he talked about a 100 -year US assignment to Gaza, with a contract similar to the Chinese Hong Kong situation with Britain.
The writer warned of the seriousness of these statements, which ""reveals the policy of US President Donald Trump and his plans towards Gaza and the region, and it comes as a continuation of his previous demonic project during his first term, and what was called the deal of the century at the time, which was intended for the Zionists to rule their grip from the Euphrates to The Nile, and the realization of the dream of the Greater State of Israel. ""
He added: ""Therefore, I think that the next with Trump will be worse, and will work to impose a new reality by force.""
The writer called for unifying the Arab position, especially from Egypt and Jordan, as well as the unification of the Palestinian position ""to confront these plans targeting the Palestinian presence, and the project of the Palestinian state and thus completely end the Palestinian issue.""
He wrote: ""It is time to pressure by the international community to Israel ... and obligating it to implement all the laws and treaties approved by international legitimacy, which recognize the rights and just cause of the Palestinian people, foremost of which is its right to self -determination and national independence.""
Finally, we conclude our tour from a newspaper The Israeli Jerusalem Post, which wrote an editorial entitled ""Reducing the importance of the Holocaust: The statements of Irish President are equal to the Nazi War and the Gaza war.""
In its editorial, the newspaper attacked the Irish President, Michael Higins, due to a speech recently during the event to commemorate the eighty anniversary of the liberation of the ""Auschwitz Berkino"" detention camp in Poland, which witnessed violations of the Nazis against the Jews, in what is known as the Holocaust or ""Holocaust"".
The newspaper criticized the Irish president because he welcomed the ceasefire in Gaza, and pointed to the horrific humanitarian conditions experienced by the residents of the Gaza Strip.
She wrote: ""In a strange distortion of the meaning of today, which is supposed to commemorate the six million Jews who were slaughtered at the hands of the Nazis, Higins expressed his contempt for Israel; a haven and guardian of the Jews and the guarantor that the Holocaust will not be repeated.""
She added: ""Higins was not satisfied with giving similarities (between the Holocaust) and between the Israeli war in Gaza to liberate the hostages - whom Hamas detained after its brutal attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 - but also focused on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, rather than more than 90 hostages are still being held by the terrorist group Brutality.
The newspaper quoted Higins as saying: ""The sadness that the horrific actions - which occurred on October 7 caused, and the (Israeli) response to it - for families is unimaginable. The loss of civilian lives, the displacement of people, the destruction of homes and institutions are all things that go beyond Understand. To save more lives. ""
Al -Sahfah believes that Hignz clearly tried to link the Holocaust and the actions of Israel in Gaza over the past sixteen months, citing his saying: ""When wars and conflicts are accepted or presented as an endless, humanity is the loser. The war is not the natural state of humanity, but cooperation."" .
Higins has talked about the ""high price"" that prompted during the conflict, which is ""the loss of civilian lives, most of them women and children, displaced them, losing their homes and losing the institutions necessary for the same life,"" according to the newspaper.
She concluded: ""It is clear that the lessons that the world needed to learn from the Holocaust has become confused, and fades whenever we move away from the actual events that occurred. With the death of the death Survivors, and with them their direct accounts of the horrors committed against the Jews, will be easier for people like Hignz to reduce their size, and use them to make cheap political gains.

US President Donald Trump presents dialectical ideas about the proposed solutions in Gaza, which raises wide reactions at the regional and international levels. In the presentation of the newspapers today, we review three articles that present different visions on these statements and their repercussions.
We start from the Israeli newspaper ""Jerusalem Post"" and an article entitled ""Trump will save the world from extremist Islam"", as the newspaper notes that the American President ""realizes that what happened in Gaza was not a genocide by Israel, but rather a genocide committed by Hamas against its people.""
""We have to reconsider the way of our thinking if we believe that Trump is hasty and volatile and his actions cannot be expected,"" says an article author Mimi Bear, a communications advisor and public relations in an Israeli company. And justice and morals, because they are proud of life, and not those who glorify the bloodshed, killing and terrorism, ""as she put it.
The writer is attacking Europe by indicating that ""her reception for Muslim immigrants has reshaped her cities, and that the policy of tolerance that she followed in the beginning turned into surrender, with many governments unwillingness European in the face of extremism within its borders, ""and that these governments"" surrendered to political accounts, ""she said.
For the White House, the author believes that for Israel and the world a positive development, in exchange for Europe, which depicts the ""terrorists"" as fighters for freedom, while describing the Israeli army as ""the power of genocide.""

Bear says Trump clearly sees the truth, ""He realizes that Israel is not the problem, but rather the first line of defense against extremist Islamic terrorism,"" she said.

""The previous US administration has fell under the pressure of criticism about Israel's support,"" the author adds, noting that ""Joe Biden provided major military assistance, but at the same time he was reluctant to provide decisive aid in critical moments, which is the assistance that Trump re -provided."" .

The writer refers to the demonstrations that took place within American universities, the decisions of the International Criminal Court, the Brazilian view of Israel, and the United Nations position on Israel, and says It was all the result of the surrender of the previous US administration to criticism that it was subjected to as a result of its support for Israel, she said.
The author notes that if Israel would completely cut aid for a few days from the Gaza Strip, Hamas would collapse under internal pressure, according to its vision, and that this would have accelerated the release of the hostages and the collapse of what it described as the ""terrorist system"".
As for the proposed displacement plan, the writer indicates that the vicinity of Israel includes 22 Arab countries and 57 countries with a majority of Muslim, and that the area of ??Sinai exceeds the area of ??Israel and Gaza together, while the population of Sinai is much lower than the population of Gaza, which is what it deems to be justified ""logical Exactly ""for Trump's proposal to transfer the Gazans to Sinai, asking Egypt to"" bear responsibility instead of pressure on Israel. ""
The author concludes with alerting the world that there is one fact that should not be denied; It is that ""the region between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean River can only accommodate one country, and there will be no solution to two states,"" she said.
In an article in the American newspaper ""The New York Times"", the writer Nicholas Christophe is discussing Trump's proposal to transfer the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and the supervision of the United States On its redevelopment, explaining that this proposal is a ""flagrant violation of international law.""
""The forced transmission of the population is prohibited under the Geneva Conventions, and the Nuremberg Court described it after the Second World War as a war crime.""
Christophe emphasizes that this plan will lead to a ""ethnic cleansing"" of more than two million Palestinians in Gaza, which could result in catastrophic repercussions.
He adds: ""Even if the proposal is carried out, Gaza will not become an American land, just as Russia cannot include parts of Ukraine legally, the United States or Israel cannot annex Gaza as well.""
According to Christophe, this type of ideas is nothing more than ""strange and impractical"" statements from Trump, noting that such statements harm the reputation of the United States in the world.

The writer asks whether Trump is planning to send American forces to displace civilians from Gaza to the Sinai desert by force, noting that if he refuses to spend $ 40 billion to support the US Development Agency, how will he secure the billions necessary to transport and settle in two million people?
Christophe believes that Egypt and Jordan, which Trump may think they are candidates for reception The Palestinians will refuse to host them, pointing to the Arab anger at the idea of ??forced transport, saying: ""The Arab world is seen from the perspective of what happened in 1948, when about 800,000 Arabs were expelled or displaced with the founding of Israel.""
Christophe recognizes the harsh situation in Gaza, noting that ""the sector is witnessing the highest amputation rates among children compared to any other place in the world,"" according to the United Nations.
He adds that if Trump offers the residence of these children in the ""Mara Lago"" resort for a year voluntarily, this will be a good human gesture, but he considers that forcing them to leave their homeland is a ""crime against humanity.""
Christophe concludes his article, warning that ""unrealistic"" suggestions may distract from the ceasefire in Gaza, threatening the way towards re -igniting the war.
In the end, Christophe notes that Trump needs to focus more on achieving the ceasefire in Gaza, rather than continuing his dreams about ethnic cleansing.
We conclude the press tour with an article published in the newspaper ""The Korea Times"" describing Trump's proposal as ""a flagrant violation of international law and an attack on human dignity."" The author of the article likens this proposal to what happened In the 1948 Nakba, when the Palestinians were forcibly displaced upon the establishment of Israel.
The writer notes that this proposal, which came after Trump's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on February 4, appears to be a ""harsh attempt"" to exploit the region of American interests without taking into account the dire human consequences of the Palestinians.
The writer emphasizes that this ""ridiculous"" proposal reflects the background of Trump as a real estate developer, and that his plan ignores the international consensus on the two -state solution.
On the consequences of this proposal, the writer warns of the explosion of the situation in the region, not only between the Palestinians and the Israelis, but also internationally. The proposal was criticized by the major powers such as China, Russia, Germany and the United Kingdom, as countries in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, expressed its strong opposition to this proposal.
The writer notes that ""the Saudi opposition may cause a rift in relations between the United States and the Gulf states, which threatens the stability of the region.""
He adds: ""The Palestinians have suffered for decades of injustice and tragedy since 1948, and any proposal to force them to leave their lands again is an insult to their human rights. And their association with this land. ""
The article concludes with a warning that Trump's plan represents a major shift in American policy towards the Israeli -Palestinian conflict, as it abandons the support of a ""two -state solution"" in favor of unilateral steps that may be isolated by America from its allies and undermine peace efforts.
As for his country, the author of the article ultimately refers to ""the need for South Korea to re -evaluate its foreign policy in light of the developments of American policy, and to take a balance steps between global alliances and its values ??in achieving peace and cooperation.""",UK

US President Donald Trump put on Saturday a plan to ""purify"" Gaza, saying that ""he wants Egypt and Jordan to remove the Palestinians from the Strip in an attempt to bring peace in the Middle East.""
""The Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip have suffered from death and destruction for 15 months in one of the largest humanitarian crimes in the 21st century, just to stay on their home and homeland. Therefore, he will not accept any proposals or solutions Even if it seems goodwill under the guise of reconstruction, ""US President Donald Trump suggested.
Naim added, ""Our people thwarted all the plans of displacement and the alternative homeland for decades, and rejects such projects as well. We confirm that our people are able to reconstruct Gaza better than before, provided that the siege is lifted from the region,"" Naim added.
""We are talking about a million and a half million people to purify the entire area,"" Trump told reporters, describing Gaza as a ""devastating place"", saying that this step may be ""temporary or long -term.""
The Islamic Jihad movement condemned, in the strongest terms, Trump's recent statements, and called on the movement in the statement of all countries to reject what it described as the ""Trump plan"", noting in particular. In this regard to the Egyptian and Jordanian governments. She said, ""The Palestinian people with their steadfastness and resistance, will fail this plan, as I fail many previous plans.""

The statement went on to say that ""Trump's condemnation and dedicated statements are consistent with the worst in the agenda of the extreme Zionist right, and a continuation of the policy of denying the existence of the Palestinian people, their will and their rights ... It also falls within the framework of encouragement to continue to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity, to force our people to leave His land, ""according to the movement.

The armistice between Israel and the Hamas movement in the Gaza Strip entered its second week on Sunday, after the release of four Israeli hostages at Hamas and about 200 Palestinian prisoners of Israeli prisons.
However, efforts to implement the ceasefire agreement collided with new obstacles, as Israel objected to the return of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to the northern destroyer sector, due to a dispute regarding the release of Israeli civilian hostage, Erbil Jews.
Israel stipulated that Jews be released first before the opening of the Natsarim axis, which separates the southern and north of Gaza, citing Hamas's absence of an unannounced condition in the agreement stipulating the release of civilian hostages first.
For its part, sources in Hamas confirmed that Jews are alive and in good health, and that it will be released next Saturday.
On a platform installed by Hamas fighters and the jihad movement in the Palestine Square in Gaza, surrounded by small trucks loaded with large caliber rifles, a Red Cross employee sat in a bright red charging jacket alongside a masked fighter from Hamas wearing the distinctive head of the group and its military uniform.
On Saturday, the two men signed ""certificates of release of the bets"", with a sign that was lower below the slogans of the Israeli army and the security services written in the Hebrew language: ""Zionism will not prevail.""
Soon after, the four hostages came out in the middle Saffers, chants and shouts from the Gazans crowd, while the crew of Hamas cameras and photographers gathered around them.
The Israeli army announced that it had received the Israeli hostages, and said in a later statement: ""The hostages Daniel Jalboua, Carina Arif, Lerry Albag and the grace of Levy to Israeli territory, were transferred in a military helicopter to a hospital in Batah Takfa, in central Israel, accompanied by members of their families."" The atmosphere of joy ""the hostage square"" in Tel Aviv, where a crowd of Israelis gathered. The hospital announced that they were ""stable.""
The Hamas movement had detained: Kareena Ariev, Daniela Galboua and Nama Levy - all of them twenty -year -old - and Lerry Albag, 19, from a military monitoring base in Nahal Oz during the October 7, 2023 attack.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu considered that the release of the four hostages is a ""very happy moment"", while the White House stressed that Washington will continue its efforts with Israel with the aim of ""release all the remaining hostages.""
On the other hand, the Israeli Prisons Authority announced the release of all Palestinian prisoners, to be released on Saturday and adult They number 200 prisoners.
More than half of them were allowed to return to their homes in the West Bank, and 16 to the Gaza Strip in exchange for the deportation of approximately 70 of their released, through Egypt to other countries such as Qatar and Turkey.

In a related context, 16 Palestinian prisoners - within 200 people released - arrived on Saturday evening, at the European Gaza Hospital in Khan Yunis, after their release during the first stage of the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip.
The Rafah crossing from the Egyptian side also arrived at 70 Palestinian prisoners on board two buses from the Karam Abu Salem crossing, who were removed from the Palestinian territories according to the ceasefire agreement and the exchange of hostages and prisoners between Hamas and Israel.

Several Western and Arab newspapers are still dealing with the proposals of US President Donald Trump on Gaza, which raises great controversy between regional and global circles ... and this is what we review today in the diverse tour of the newspapers.
We start with what Carolina Landman wrote in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz under the title: ""Neither king nor genius: Trump's plan on Gaza humiliated Netanyahu.""
The writer notes that all the fame that Netanyahu gained is his success in managing the conflict, ""but we saw how all the risks he fought with Hamas succeeded, and the chess he played with its former leader Yahya Al -Sinwar. However, until now, nearly a year and a half has passed He still does not have the slightest idea of ??how to get us out of this impasse.
""There is nothing more embarrassing than Trump with Netanyahu, like someone who says:"" O my little one, let my father clean the chaos that I caused here in my absence, ""according to Landsman.
The author described the silence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when US President Donald Trump told the whole world that ""the United States will control the Gaza Strip"" as ""embarrassing silence.""

Landsman wondered, ""What is it The most humiliating of all this? It was possible that it would be different if the Americans took control of Gaza with their own army and managed their own transportation, but do not make the master of America first laugh (you mean Trump). Should American shoes be dirty in the soil of Gaza? First of all, the Israeli forces will purify them for the benefit of Westerners, with the blood and lives of our sons and daughters, ""according to the writer.
The writer touched that ""Trump wants the same deal that the settlers want: the maximum amount of land, and the lowest number of Arabs. Netanyahu will get the land for free, and build it at a cheap price.""
""This is the deal that Trump offers- the deal of the century! Under this deal, the least important sweat will make ethnic cleansing, after which the least importance of leaving can leave,"" she says.
When controlling Gaza, the writer explained that ""the United States will get one of the most strategic ports in the Middle East, and the Israeli army will be responsible for coordinating security.""

We move to the Financial Times for an article written by Kim Ghattas entitled: ""Saudi Arabia swings between excitement and caution amid Trump's gambling over Gaza.""
The writer believes that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was living in good weeks, as she quickly intervened to take advantage of opportunities in a largely re -formed area in the wake of the 15 -month Gaza war in Gaza and military operations against Lebanon, according to her expression.
She said: ""After US President Donald Trump met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, he threw some chaos in those crises.""
When Trump suggested last week that Jordan and Egypt would receive the Palestinians from Gaza (which is equivalent to ethnic cleansing), according to Ghattas, the Arab ministers sent a message to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, warning of deportation. Jordan said that it will be seen as a war declaration. Then, on Tuesday, and next to Netanyahu, Trump suggested that ""the United States may turn Gaza into a new ruralra,"" according to the author of the article.
Within hours, the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a ""strongly worded statement in which it made it clear that it would not retract its call to establish a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders.""
The writer pointed out that ""the country that has the largest influence It is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman should remember that he holds major negotiation papers: Trump wants to invest a trillion dollars in America and reduce oil prices. ""
Ghattas asked: ""Can Saudi Arabia obtain a defense agreement with Trump and a normalization agreement with Israel, which accused it of genocide, while also fulfilling the promise to establish a Palestinian state? The reward will be enormous, and the risks are more than that, for both Saudi Arabia and the region.
The National Security Adviser to Trump, Mike Waltz later, explained that the aim of the proposal is to pressure the Arab countries to reach a special solution on a plot of land that is not suitable for living, as the writer explains that ""the Arab countries have put peace initiatives on the table since 2002, and it was the main obstacle. In front of the discussion of (the next day) of Gaza, it is the Netanyahu government constantly. ""
The diver photographed the situation in the area, such as ""entering the major chess area in the Middle East with a weak square represented in the destroyed Gaza, and the encouraging Israeli right, And the American president, who looks at everything as a real estate deal, even when he violates international law. While Iran requires the weakest opportunity in various parts of the region the participation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, this challenge differs in its size, ""the article writer said.

We conclude the newspapers with an article in Al -Sharq Al -Awsat newspaper by Amal Moussa under the title: ""From liquidation to displacement!""
The writer said, ""Trump seemed fond of amending geography and international map in a way that does not recognize international covenants, nor the sovereignty of states, nor the people's right to self -determination.""
""The international community has never heard something similar to Trump's intentions, which he said in a dominant, superior and colonial tone that brought the world back to the point of zero in law and rights,"" according to the author Moussa.
And she continued: ""No one occurred to anyone that a head of state, in a high, confident and inherent tone, uttered the displacement of all Palestinians, and forced two countries by name to receive them. He did not happen that a person before him thought of a full robbery, in broad daylight and in public, on countries such as the Gaza Strip and Canada "".
The writer believes that ""although the Middle East is in a moment of extreme confusion, And the Arab world is suffering from a chronic headache ... not to mention economic tremors and labor in various regions and in the world as if history folds a page to write others .. Trump managed to create successive shocks to the world.
Moussa asked: ""What made Trump's ambitions flatten fiction and see the geography of the world merely an erasure, and its formation as interests and accounts like?""
""We may not exaggerate if we say that the Israeli imagination himself did not reach what Trump reached, according to Moses, who explained,"" even if his plan is very favorable to the Israeli dream, and represents the best solution to something that has always exhausted the Israelis, which is the Palestinian issue. ""
She emphasized that ""the plan to displace the Palestinians from Gaza, and the superior and upscale discourse towards Egypt and Jordan, require the overestimation of the deep hibernation because the man blew a bomb that does not occur to the mind or the mind, as if he was talking about a plot of land that was forced to force its owner to sell it because it has a public interest According to the writer.
She concluded: ""Yes, Trump's talk about Gaza feels the oppressed Arab listener that he is the owner of Gaza, and he has the disposal of it and those on it.""",UK
"The Israeli right grabbed the proposal of US President Donald Trump to displace the inhabitants of the Gaza Strip, with great enthusiasm, as it is the proposal that he wanted to implement since the beginning of the aggression on Gaza, and is considered one of the goals of the unofficial war.
During the war, the Ministry of Intelligence Affairs prepared a detailed plan (in some of its comic vehicles) on the scenario of displacement from the Gaza Strip, of course this ministry was subsequently replaced, and its plan remained pending.
The Israeli right organized a conference in January to displace the residents of the Gaza Strip with the participation of ministers and members of the Knesset from the government coalition, and the official right -wing movement continued in this regard, and the option of displacement was not limited to the right, as Knesset member Ram bin Barak was published from the opposition ""Future"" party. He previously held the position of head of materials, in partnership with the Knesset member of Likud Danny Danone (currently the delegate of Israel in The United Nations) is an article calling for ""voluntary migration"" for the residents of the Gaza Strip, and their distribution to the countries of the world.
As the aggression continued, and Israel's inability to displace the residents of the Strip, it tried to carry out a partial displacement plan in the northern Gaza Strip since last October and failed to do so.
Trump has revived the idea of ??displacement in the thought of the Israelis again yet He presented details of the plan in the press conference held with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington, and a week later, the Step-Security Ministerial Council (Cabinet) adopted Trump's plan officially during his first meeting after Netanyahu's return, and Netanyahu considered it a great plan, and he later admitted that Israel participated The US administration is to develop the plan and affected Trump's position on it.
Trump's plan to displace the vitality of the natural Zionist imagination that resolving the conflict with the Palestinians lies in the displacement, a path that the Zionist movement did not resolve in 1948 and 1967.
Trump's plan is the base in the Zionist-Israeli thinking, not the exception, and opposition to the transcript of the Palestinians in the previous four decades by political currents that turned out that it had no moral reasons, but rather because they believe that the displacement that carries the act of ethnic cleansing is no longer acceptable, and when Trump put it welcomed by most Israeli political movements and parties represented in the Knesset (with the exception of the Democrats Party- Work- headed by Yair Golan).
In the wake of Israel's adoption of the Trump proposal, the Israeli Defense Minister began building a special administration within a ministry Defense to prepare a detailed plan to displace the residents of the sector, through the economic privileges of the population, and pushing them towards leaving through the Israeli land, sea and air crossings, and the administration consists of employees and representatives of different ministries in the government, to work to implement them without clarifying whether it requires the occupation of the sector or not.
The Israeli debate about Trump's plan was divided between three currents, between those who oppose them morally, and they are the minority in the Israeli scene, and between those who support them, but consider them uncont subject to, but he believes that it can be employed to pressure the actors regionally to achieve Israeli interests, and between a third current that supports it and believes it is Employable if the United States is serious in this regard.
At the level of the Israeli Jewish society, in a poll conducted by the Jewish People's Policies Institute, 53% of Israeli Jews support the proposal and the possibility of its implementation, while 30% support it, but they believe that it is not implemented and impractical, while the rest opposes the proposal for various reasons.
In a follow -up to the Israeli debate, especially the official rhetoric, it can easily be noted that the talk about the proposal quickly declined, and this is linked to The rhetorical decline in the retreat of talking about the issue within the American administration, especially for President Trump, who said that his plan was great, but he will not impose it but rather recommend it.
It is a clear decline in the severity of the speech and its seriousness compared to what was at the beginning of the proposal, especially in the joint statement with Netanyahu, and it seemed that the American officials, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, indicate that Trump's proposal is proposed unless the Arabs suggest an alternative to him, which indicates that The American administration retracted the proposal as a goal to a tool to pressure regional actors; To present a political perception of the future of the Gaza Strip, consistent with the American goal of ending Hamas rule in the Gaza Strip, in exchange for reconstruction without displacement.
In monitoring the Israeli discourse on the eve of the end of the first stage of the ceasefire agreement, and the start of the second stage talks, Israel returned to talk about achieving the goals of the war of the expropriation of Gaza, and ending the rule of Hamas, without talking about Trump's proposal for displacement, and evoking Trump's discourse about the importance of release All Israeli prisoners and hostages quickly.
Israel realizes that there is a political path that interacts in the region larger and wider than The political path of the ceasefire agreement, and that this wide Arab rockets came as a response to the Trump proposal for displacement, and communicates with the American administration, a path that may ultimately lead to an Arab proposal with American approval that starts from an equation, reconstruction without displacement, and without the rule of Hamas.
Although the wide political path, it ultimately leads to the end of Hamas’s rule within an Arab-Palestinian consensus and with American consent, it is considered a pressure on Israel, which wants to achieve this by itself through a path that is the participation and effective effective effect in it.
Therefore, Israel put its conditions for the talks of the second stage of the agreement, especially disarmament in the Gaza Strip. The Arab proposal that prevents the displacement puts the Netanyahu government in a dilemma, as it stems from a Palestinian professional rule, which is independent of the Palestinian Authority and without Hamas’s participation, but it will end in the end and in the long run for the return of the Palestinian Authority as a reference for this ruling. This is what Israel does not want to confirm that it wants a rule without enthusiasm and the Palestinian Authority together (without enthusiasm and Abbas, according to Netanyahu's propaganda saying).
The Arab proposal ends if he succeeds in convincing the American administration, the displacement plan, The Israeli dream is in general and the right in particular with the displacement of the residents of the Gaza Strip, so the American discourse and the Israeli disclosure fell from the displacement plan, and it remained present in the right -wing speech in the government.
The Israeli effort will revolve in the next stage to evoke its impact on the Arab proposal on the reconstruction and the rule of the Gaza Strip, yet the American administration has a broader political path than the current ceasefire agreement, it will impose on Israel to engage in the second -stage talks, and to end the file ""problem Gaza Strip.
This threatens the government of Netanyahu, which has been conglomery around itself after Trump's proposal to displace the Gaza Strip, and Netanyahu tried to stabilize his government by marketing that the displacement obliges everyone to stay in the government even if the price is continuing with the current agreement, so what is expected in the end is an old dream that will be achieved by displacement Strip residents.
The success of the Arab proposal and the seriousness of the Arab movement in this regard will be an impressive factor, and perhaps the most influential since 1967. It prevented displacement, the stop of war, reconstruction, and building a Palestinian rule, all of this may eventually lead to thwarting Israeli plans and opens a path. Seriously for the West Bank and Gaza unit in the long run.

"
The Guardian newspaper published an editorial in which it dealt with the decision of US President Donald Trump to impose sanctions on the International Criminal Court.
She said that the decision was not surprising, because Trump did the same thing in his first presidential term, when the International Court opened an investigation into possible war crimes in Afghanistan.
But his attack this time, according to the newspaper, is greater and more dangerous because it affects the foundations of the court and threatens its ability to do its job.
Al -Gardyan states that the United States refused to join the International Criminal Court ""for fear of investigating its actions and the actions of its allies."" Joe Biden affected the International Criminal Court, and the United States claims that she is committing the international system based on the law, when he justified the arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin, while describing Netanyahu's arrest warrant as ""ridiculous"".
The newspaper believes that the only law that Trump knows is the jungle law. His style of this is transactions and coercion instead of diplomacy and alliances. ""The large monsters are hungry, and the rest of the compliance or escape.""
End proposed stories
The Guardian adds that Trump's doctrine is built that ""the strong is always right"", It appears in his ""reckless and unethical vocation to the ethnic liquidation in Gaza, in order for the United States to possess Riviera in the Middle East.""
She says that the American forces are not expected to sweep Canada, as his proposal for Gaza cannot be achieved, but observers warn of the need to carry Trump's words literally seriously, whatever his ideas are ""ridiculous"".
Whether or not the United States expands its borders, all indicators indicate that Trump will support Israel and Russia to include more lands, and thus encourage other countries to use force to redraw its borders, according to the Guardian.
The newspaper believes that Trump's attack on the International Criminal Court is another evidence of its importance, and the importance of international law. She adds that the resentment of countries like Britain from Trump's decisions is not enough, as what is required is to protect the international court and not solidarity with it.

It is worth the end
The Independent newspaper published an article written by Dr. Sarah Al -Husseini, Director of the Palestinian -British Committee, calling on the British government to take a position Strong and frankly against any ethnic liquidation plan for the Palestinians in their lands.
Sarah says that Donald Trump's statements of his desire to ""seize"" Gaza, to make it the Middle East Rvira, is the greatest denial of the Palestinians' right to self -determination and return, expressed by American departments so far.
She believes that the British government is required today a fundamental shift and standing alongside the Palestinians, ""after it has stood since the Balfour Declaration in 1917 alongside the occupation in his oppression of the Palestinians and stripping them of their property.""
The writer is calling for Britain for a decisive position of no less than a clear condemnation of Trump's statements, and an immediate end to British military, economic and diplomatic support for Israel.
Sarah states that the British Prime Minister, Kiir Stamer, had an opportunity in Parliament to condemn Trump's statements, in which he explicitly called for the American occupation of the Palestinian territories and the ethnic liquidation of the Palestinians, but he escaped from the question as described.
She adds that there is no indication that his government will stop its military support and economic cooperation with Israel, as it is binding on many international agreements, including the agreement to prevent and punish genocide, which is that Britain signed it.
The writer notes that Trump's decision to stop the funding of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees, which Israel has completely banned, because it provides humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees.
Although Britain bears a historical responsibility in creating the original Palestinian refugee crisis, it is today, according to the writer, silent that does not object to the prohibition of the United Nations Agency and prevent funding for it.

Al -Quds newspaper published an editorial in which it dealt with the statements of the Israeli Minister of Defense, in which he called for a plan that allows every Palestinian who wants to leave the Gaza Strip anywhere in the world to leave.
Jerusalem says that this policy, which appears to be a desire, is in fact intimidation, and it is an attempt to ""absent the Palestinian role and eliminate any representation of it in the sector,"" which is also ""a policy of ethnic cleansing and completely displacement of a defenseless people.""
The newspaper warns that ""Trump's immoral plan will ignite the situation in the West Bank with the approaching month of Ramadan,"" and indicated that the head of the Israeli Military Intelligence Division warned of ""serious security consequences for Trump's plan to displace Gaza residents.""
And you say Jerusalem, ""The message of the Palestinian people is clear, and it is the rejection of Trump's suspicious plan and refused to deal with it, or think about it, but rather buried it forever.""
The newspaper believes that Trump's statements regarding Gaza ""give the green light to Netanyahu to resume the fighting, and to violate the ceasefire"", because the return of the fighting will facilitate ""the process of displacing the Palestinians and expelling them from their lands, and emptying the Gaza Strip from them"" according to the article.",UK
"They disappeared, Trams, on the Sabbath, for a controversial proposal, which he called ""purification"" of Gaza, which focuses on the transfer of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Jordan and Egypt, in the context of what he considered to be rearranged for the ""completely demolished"" region.
The American president said: ""I prefer to communicate with a number of Arab countries and build housing in a different place where they may be able to live in peace,"" noting that the transfer of the residents of Gaza may be ""temporary or long -term.""
On the other hand, Trump raised the ban that Biden imposed on the supply of bombs weighing 2000 pounds to Israel, due to fears of the impact that he might have on the civilian population, especially in the city of Rafah. He also said: ""Many of the things that Israel requested and paid (money) for its way now.""
This proposal sparked a condemnation by the Islamic Resistance Movement and the Palestinian Authority alike. A member of the Hamas Political Bureau, Basem Naim, vowed to ""thwart"" Trump's idea. On Sunday, he said: ""As our people have failed for the decades of all the plans of displacement and the alternative homeland, such projects will be shrouded.""
For its part, the proposed Islamic Jihad movement condemned and considered it encouraged to commit ""war crimes and crimes against humanity by forcing our people to leave their land.""
as Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas expressed ""condemnation"" and ""severe rejection"" of any project aimed at ""displacing our people from the Gaza Strip.""
This, and Egypt and Jordan opposed the Trump proposal. Where Cairo rejected any forced displacement of Palestinians. So, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stressed in a statement on Sunday that ""Egypt continues to support the steadfastness of the Palestinian people on its soil and adhere to its legitimate rights.""
In Jordan, Foreign Minister Ayman Al -Safadi affirmed his country's rejection of Trump's proposal, stressing the adherence of his country, which receives 2.3 million Palestinian refugees, with a two -state solution, ""a single way to achieve security, stability and peace in the region.""
For its part, the League of Arab States warned of ""attempts to remove the Palestinian people from their land,"" saying in a statement: ""It cannot be called the deportation of humans and their displacement from their land forcibly except that it is an ethnic cleansing.""
While Netanyahu did not comment on the American proposal, the right -wing Israeli financial minister in Balselm Shamroch on Sunday saw what Trump said ""a great idea"", considering that the Palestinians ""would be able to build a new and good life elsewhere.""
But Tel Aviv has previously presented projects similar to removing the Palestinians from the Strip. The last of which was the displacement to the ""human islands"" Or to the Egyptian Sinai.
In the late 2023, that is, in the third month of the war, UN officials warned of the possibility of the displacement of the Palestinian people of the Gaza Strip into Egypt, in light of the displacement of the majority of them and the incursion of the Israeli forces within the besieged sector.
At that time, the Commissioner -General of the Relief and Works Agency for the Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) Philip Lazarini accused Israel of paving the way to expel the residents of the sector collectively to Egypt. He pointed out in an article published by the Los Angeles Times to the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the crowd of displaced civilians who have escaped fighting near the border in the north and then the south. He said: ""The developments we are witnessing indicate attempts to transfer the Palestinians to Egypt.""
Also read Israel's plan to ""collect a mass displacement"" of the residents of the Gaza Strip towards Sinai in Egypt?
In March 2024, the United Nations warned of the ""horrific"" nature of Israeli plans to evacuate 1.4 million Palestinians from the city of Rafah in southern Gaza to camps or ""human islands"" in the north.
In light of this, the Fund of the International Population Organization said previous statements to France 24 that ""the United Nations will not participate in any enforced and irreversible evacuation. The transfer of hundreds of thousands of people to the so -called With human islands without the possibility of obtaining food, water or health care, it is not imagined. Civilians should be protected regardless of whether they are in a state of movement or stability. ""
Indeed, most of the 2.4 million people of the sector have been strained several times, due to the violent Israeli campaign that has left the war since the outbreak of 4,7,306 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and the injury of 111,483 others, according to the latest statistic announced by the Ministry of Health in Gaza on Sunday.
Historically, most Gaza population is considered Palestinian refugees or descendants of refugees. In their view, any attempt to transfer them from Gaza will be similar to the Palestinian ""Nakba"" they were exposed to in 1948 during the founding of the Hebrew state.

In the same context, the interactive encyclopedia of the Palestinian issue stated in a report that the number of refugees in Gaza exceeded 200 thousand people, after the ""Nakba"", noting that the population of the sector did not exceed Then 80 thousand people.
A United Nations report stated that the Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ""UNRWA"", has been responding since it started its mission in 1950, ""to the needs of approximately 750 thousand Palestinian refugees. Today (October 31, 2024, according to the report of the report), is sponsored The agency is at least five million and nine hundred thousand Palestinian refugees.
The Palestinian Statistics Agency reported in a previous report with the anniversary of the ""Nakba"", that the number of Palestinians abroad has doubled about 10 times since 1948. Palestinians in the world 14.63 million people at the end of the year 2023. ""
The same agency said in another report published on June 20, that the percentage of refugee population in Palestine reached about 42.2 percent of the total Palestinian population residing in 2017. 26.3 percent are refugees in the West Bank, while the percentage of refugees in the Gaza Strip reached 66 percent "".
In light of these conditions, United Nations human rights experts said on December 30th that Israel should face The consequences of ""inflicting the maximum suffering"" of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, stressing that they challenge international law and enjoys the protection of its allies. And they added, ""This siege, along with the expanded evacuation orders, appears to be aimed at permanently displacing the local population in preparation for the annexation of Gaza.""

For his part, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volcker Turk, also considered the destruction operations that the Israeli forces carried out to establish a ""buffer zone"" with Gaza, that they are agreed with the ""exclusion of military operations"" stipulated in international humanitarian law.

Volcker Vipian, published by the United Nations on its official website on February 9, 2024, said Israel ""did not provide convincing reasons for this widespread destruction of civil infrastructure.""
The UN official confirmed in the same statement that The destruction of homes and other civil infrastructure in Gaza ""exacerbates the displacement of societies"" that were inhabited in those areas before the war, adding: ""It seems that it aims or leads to the return of civilians to these areas is impossible.""
He continued: ""The (Israeli) authorities are mentioned that the forced displacement of civilians may constitute a war crime.""
To shed more highlighting Trump's statements, timing and consisting, while the Palestinians in Gaza returned extensively to the northern Gaza Strip, Hourane Arab Al -Rantawyemir, the Al -Quds Center for Political Studies, based in Amman in Jordan.
Oraib Al -Rantawi: Trump is seeking to develop his vision to resolve the (Arab -Israeli) conflict, but in a way that is driven by his feeling of strength, greatness and influence that has no response after winning the recent elections and the victory of his party in the congressional council elections.
Trump believes that he has a magic stick that strikes right and left, so all crises are solved in this sense. He is inspired by the first century applicant, according to which a third of the West Bank was granted to Israel and recognized Jerusalem as its capital and the transfer of its country's embassy to it, to check it and increase a project to displace the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip. Attracted by the Trump family and his son -in -law Garid Kushner, who was an explicit ghost in his lecture at Harvard University, when he proposed a new Las Vegas building on the precious coast of Gaza in this sense. He appointed him and appointed Israeli companies on the northern Gaza in particular, in order to establish giant resorts and investments.

Of course, this cannot be implemented with the presence of the Gazans, but rather they must be displaced in order to empty this area of ??its inhabitants. This is what happened and will not happen. Moreover, what we have witnessed today is a solemn return of nearly a million Palestinians on their feet to the northern Gaza Strip, and the positions issued by Cairo and the displacement positions, can slap the first attempt by Trump to approach the file of the conflict in the region, and reveals that his view of this The issue is naive and superficial and does not indicate a deep knowledge of its roots, dynamism and fate.
The Palestinians consider that any solution to their issue comes from outside their country is an Israeli conspiracy mainly, supported by this The western or that in the United States.
Therefore, they look at all the suspicion and accusation of this plan as it serves only the most fascist interests in the ""occupation state"" (Israel [clarification from the liberation team]). From there, Donald Trump and the American populist right prove to be made of the same fabric from which the extreme right was made in Israel.
Otherwise, how can the head of the greatest country adopt the vision of the fascist Israeli right and religious Zionism and its known symbols, which were terrorist classified even in Israel itself. This suspicious meeting between the two perceptions, and the hospitality that Trump's statements were met by the pillars of the Israeli religious right, are the biggest evidence that we are actually talking about phenomena made of the same fabric as we said.
The displacement from an American perspective is not a new matter. We came to Blink (the former foreign minister during the Biden era) in his first rounds after the seventh of October, promoting a temporary human displacement, as he described it in an attempt to facilitate and facilitate its swallowing by the Palestinians or the Egyptians and Jordanians.
He rejected that project and thwarted his endeavors in that attempt. Today, Trump comes with a rugged and thickened to display the project itself, When asked if he was temporary, he said he was long.
Even if he says it will be temporary, the Palestinian and Arab experience in dealing with this occupation reveals that every temporary is always in the Israeli custom. Therefore, these statements sparked not only rejection, condemnation and condemnation of a Palestinian, but all the feelings of anxiety and rejection in Oman and Cairo allies of Washington, who have realized since the first century applause and confirmed to them today more than ever, after Trump's statements, that the United States is ready to turn a blind eye to any damages It can be attached to its Arab allies if it is in the service of the Israeli interest as the right knows Zionist.
Therefore, there was anger, angry and angry opinion against these statements. Likewise, Jordan's security, stability, identity and entity, which is threatened with displacement projects, cannot be seen as side or secondary losses, but rather supreme interests, the state is committed to preserving it, and the people are committed to poisoning them, and what applies to Jordan applies to Egypt as well, and there is no These suspicious projects can be accepted.
I do not think that we are facing the scenario of the re -occupation of Gaza. Trump came with a promise to bring peace and stop the war. But there is a difference Between the two things, especially since the first requires response to the rights and interests of the main parties, especially the Palestinian people afflicted by occupation, racial discrimination and genocide.
In my estimation, I do not think that Trump will go towards this option, not even in Israel there is an opportunity to renew the war on the Gaza Strip after all that happened. This is not likely, especially since we read in the Israeli press that the return of the Palestinians with this intensity to the north makes the option to resume the war in Gaza is difficult for the Israeli army.
But we also learned from the experience, that it is not permissible to bet, neither on the credibility of Washington nor the situation in Israel. We see a fierce extremist right that has committed all war crimes of its cases. The width of the wall was struck in the system of moral and human values, which keeps the door open to the possibilities. But in general, the war scenario is unlikely.
Displacement is a war crime in every sense of this word. Ethnic cleansing is a war crime intended for everything it means.
Trump's statements were not a tongue when he used a cleansing expression in his description of what he was planning in the Gaza Strip. There are also legal and legal estimates that say Donald Trump can be tried if the balance of international justice is still in charge, on charges of inciting war crimes in this sense and in this expansion.
The United Nations will also not accept these theses, because its reference is the decisions that were issued from 1948 to the present day that in terms of ending the occupation, establishing the Palestinian state, self -determination, the capital, Jerusalem, settlement and wall, the right of return, and the issue of UNRWA.
There is a system of international references that conflict and all collide with displacement and disinfection projects. Therefore, I think Trump should explain his position on the United Nations platform if he still believes in this international community and international legitimacy.
He was the one who has never appeared in respect of these institutions, and even rushed to withdraw from many of them and stop funding for them. Consequently, the current American position as Trump expressed, is in a clash with international legitimacy and international law, and puts its owner in front of legal accountability, at least in principle, although it is difficult to implement this matter.

How does Trump's policy in America's position affect the international scene? Does the plan to displace Palestinians from Gaza become a reality? What about the political vision of the American president for foreigners?
These are questions that international newspapers touched in their articles today, as writers discussed the impact of Trump's policies not only in the context of the war in Gaza, but also in his threats related to Greenland, the customs duties war, and other issues that occupy international public opinion.
The start of the American newspaper ""The New York Times"", in which he wrote an article between Rhodes entitled ""This is not Donald Trump, which was elected by America.""
Rhodes, the deputy of the National Security Adviser during the Obama era, says Trump's foreign policy reflects a decline in America's self -confidence, threatening to weaken its global position.
The writer remembers the establishment of the US Agency for International Development (US ID), when foreign policy focused on defending freedom and strengthening international institutions. But at the present time, the writer believes that American policy is completely different, as it threatens to invade small countries, withdraws from international institutions, and informally suggests the implementation of the purification Ethnic in Gaza.
End proposed stories
This shift in foreign policy reflects a decline in concepts such as freedom, self -determination and collective security, which is essential values ??in America after they fought two global wars, according to Rhodes.
The writer adds that Trump was nominated to re -election with a promise to transform America's position in the world, promises to change national security and international trade policies, and sought to strengthen his authority by filling in federal positions with personalities loyal to him.
But the writer believes that Trump's foreign policy is losing America's international confidence and respect, and does not reflect power. He points out that Trump in his endeavor to expand his influence, it seems closer to the tyrannical leaders who seek regional expansion to consolidate their authority.

It is worth the end
The writer believes that Trump's plans may be a maneuver to open negotiations on issues that may not be a priority for Americans, such as reducing fees on Panama's transit ships, or reaching resources in Greenland. But he also indicates another possibility, which is that Trump may really mean what he says about regional expansion.
Rhodes believes that Trump's goals are not It reflects strength, rather it reflects ""childish"" behavior. His threats to the invasion of Panama, Greenland or commercial wars with Canada and Mexico shows ""aggressive"" that undermines the international status of the United States.
The writer notes that Trump's proposal to possess the United States to Gaza and turn it into the Middle East ""Rvira"" was very surprising, indicating that ""these proposals may not be achieved, but it enhances the idea of ??forcing the Palestinians in Gaza to abandon their land, while ignoring the security of neighboring countries such as Egypt and Jordan "".
In the context of his talk about Gaza, the writer says that if Trump was already concerned with the suffering of the people of Gaza, he would not have sought to destroy the International Development Agency responsible for supporting reconstruction and providing humanitarian assistance there.
Rhodes concludes his article by saying that America has become a declining superpower seeking to restore its lost position, considering that Trump's alliance with Mask indicates a future that may lack the rules that govern the use of power and expose the country to great challenges globally.
To the Israeli newspaper ""Jerusalem Post"", in which the writer Dan Perry says that since the beginning of the Israeli -Palestinian conflict, there have been Jews who reject the presence of the Arabs, as well as the situation with the Arabs towards Jews.
It was not necessary for a person to be extremist on either side to feel that the Earth is narrow for two different and vicious peoples. However, the only idea that ""crazy"" adopted is the idea of ??expulsion, according to Perry.
Trump presents an ""incomplete"" plan to displace two million Palestinians from Gaza, and in this context the writer raises several questions if we take Trump's statements seriously, such as: Will Hamas remain in Gaza after Israel's withdrawal? Will Trump send American forces to fight them? Is the displacement plan from Gaza achieved?
The writer believes that there is no need to analyze Trump's proposals excessively, noting that the proposal is a ""dead issue"", due to his rejection from some Arab countries and the Palestinian leadership.
On the other hand, the writer believes that the strategy may be double and more intelligent than it seems, and says: ""In the short term, Trump's statements may help solve the coalition problems of the Netanyahu government, where the extreme right finds a justification for staying in the government even if the war ends and Hamas remains in Gaza "".
The writer believes that Trump may achieve ""unexpected"" success if it helps in motivating regional players to take realistic steps in Gaza after the war through the pressure of Arab countries, including That is Qatar, on Hamas to step down as a condition for providing aid to rebuild Gaza without its presence.
The writer notes that if there is real support from the Arab countries and the West to form a civilian government of technocrats in Gaza, this government must work in parallel with the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, in line with Egypt and the Gulf states and in coordination with a calm Western support.
As for Trump's proposal to make Gaza not suitable for housing, the writer agrees that Gaza residents should not be crowded in an unpopular place. It indicates that the situation before the war was ""very bad because of Hamas's rule, which increased the poverty of the population, in addition to the population density that formed tremendous psychological pressure.""
The writer concludes that the current proposals may hold the situation, but it may be the beginning of motivating regional players towards a realistic arrangement after the war.

We conclude our tour of the British newspaper ""The Guardian"", and an article by John Machar, in which he wonders about the reason for the continuation of foreigners, especially the French and the British, in asking a question about the ""political vision"" of President Trump, despite his contradictory and irrational actions, according to his description.
The writer reviews a description of the ""negative"" character For Trump, who is different from narcissism, as Trump is considered ""selfish"" only sees himself, and does not show any real interest in others, which is evident in his behaviors and statements; Like joking about his dating to his daughter or his insult to Biden during the inauguration ceremony.
Then the writer highlights how Trump raises an attack on him from various political spectrums, to remain the center of attention. It is also reported that Trump prefers to be attacked instead of ignoring him, which shows his lack of interest in the true consequences of his policies, such as threats to impose customs duties on Canada and Mexico.
Despite Trump's ""anxious policies"", such as the temporary suspension of federal aid, the writer believes that Trump is not interested if these policies fail to improve the situation.
""The most important thing for him is the media influence and keeping attention, while enjoying a political battle he sees is enhancing his position,"" according to Marxor.
In conclusion, the writer warns that this Trump's self -tendency can lead to harmful effects in the short term, especially if others are subjected to it without long thinking, indicating that short -term threats may harm more than anything else.",UK

", Israeli Prison Service
The press tour today addresses the scenes of the release of Palestinian prisoners after the Israeli Prisons Authority forced them to wear shirts bearing the phrase ""We do not forget or forgive"", as well as shed light on the ""trade war"" launched by US President Donald Trump on China, in addition to an article discussing a population displacement plan Gaza and the logic that Trump relies on making his similar decisions.
We start with an article in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz for the writer Gideon Levy entitled ""If there is someone who should not forget or forgive, they are the Palestinians"", in which he says that ""the image is equal to a thousand words: hundreds of Palestinian detainees and prisoners were seen, who were released on Saturday, and they are kneeling. In prison, they wear white shirts with the Blue Dawood star and a phrase that we will not forget and will not be forgiven. ""
Levy adds that ""Israel forced them to turn into animated flags of Zionism in its ugliest form,"" noting that last week witnessed a similar incident, when he was written on the bracelets of the prisoners: ""The eternal people are never forgotten, I will pursue my enemies and find them.""
The writer criticized these phrases, which he described as ""ridiculous"", indicating that the message cannot be ignored Which Israel chose to attach to the bodies of the released prisoners: We will not forget and will not forgive, and we will pursue you!
Levy believes that Hamas also carried the relevant hostages from Gaza, a message that ""time is running out,"" adding, ""Even if this is cheap propaganda, it cannot be ignored.""

The writer says that ""the world, with Israel, has forgotten what Nazi Germany did, and Vietnam forgot what the United States did, and the Algerians forgot what happened from France, and the Indians forgot what happened from Britain - except"" the eternal people "", it will never forget!

It is worth the end
The writer pointed out that ""foreign media cameras focused less on the Palestinians, while the Israeli cameras ignored them almost completely, and they were dealt with as all of them"" killers ""in the end, and no helicopter waited for them to transfer them to the hospital, and some of them were immediately deported from Their country! ""
The writer notes that ""the hands of a minority of these prisoners are stained with blood, but others were political prisoners and opponents of the regime, most of whom were Gaza residents who fell into the trap of that hell.""
The writer adds: “Some of these prisoners were kidnapped from Khan Yunis, and the Israelis kidnapped Nir Oz, but Israel dealt with them all that they were part of the strength of the elite of Hamas. Their families were waiting impatiently for them, and with enthusiasm is no less than the enthusiasm of the Israeli families of the demons, Dikkal Chen, Truvanov and Horn. ""
He continues: ""If we judge the matter through the way each party treats prisoners and hostages - which is a very significant indication - it is difficult to define any party more humane. So is Israel adheres to the Geneva Agreement more than Hamas!""
The author adds: ""No You can claim it anymore, and this harsh impression can no longer change it. ""
We turn to the newspaper ""South China Murning Post"" and an article by Wang One in which he talks about the customs duties imposed by US President Donald Trump, and he says that after a few days of this announcement Canada and Mexico reached an agreement that satisfies the United States in exchange for the suspension of customs duties for a month.
The writer adds that China has responded with multiple counter measures, including: imposing a 15 percent customs tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas imported from the United States, and a 10 percent customs tariff on crude oil, agricultural machines and small trucks.
The writer notes that ""Beijing has not retreated, and imposed controls related to the export of rare elements such as Tungstin and Tylorium, and imposed more stricter, accurate and diversified counter measures, and the main reason is that after nearly eight years of commercial conflict, China has become more confident, powerful and flexible.""
""After Trump launched the trade war in 2018, Chinese exports to the United States faced customs customs acquaintances of about 19 percent, and now, the public used to Chinese on trade conflicts, and additional customs recognition does not constitute a 10 percent shock. ""
It shows that customs recognition not only failed to curb China's growth, but rather it helped unintentionally promoting the country's local economic strategy, especially in relation to manufacturing and technological development, American technological restrictions have accelerated China's efforts to achieve technological self -sufficiency, he said author.
The writer asserts that ""the first Trump administration has failed to defeat China, and after nearly eight years, the country has become more powerful, and it appears that the chances of the second Trump administration's success in this will be less.""
The writer notes that ""Trump's threats to customs duties may frighten Canada, Mexico or Europe, but it will not affect China, which has nearly a decade of experience in facing such policies.""
He explains that China's confidence stems from its massive manufacturing sector, which was the largest in the world for 15 consecutive years.

The writer says that instead of addressing the reasons for declining manufacturing in the United States, Trump uses customs recognition as a political tool, It makes foreign competitors a scapegoat, while ultimately damaged to consumers and American companies, he said.
It shows that if countries such as Canada, Mexico, China, and the European Union also decide to impose customs customs on American goods, American exports will suffer, inflation rates will rise, and the economy may face severe consequences.
Trump's customs recognition strategy reflects the transformation of the United States from a global leader into a regional power involved in commercial conflicts and economic stability, and from this perspective, according to the author, Trump's policies do not make America great again, but rather work to accelerate its decline.
We turn to the Al -Quds Al -Quds Setin and an article by James Zoghbi, entitled ""Trump ... and distracts from the fundamental issues.""
The writer refers to his first reaction to President Donald Trump's proposals on Gaza, which is rejection as strange and separate from reality, seriously provocative, illegal, and indifferent to the humanity of the Palestinians, he says.
But the writer believes that Trump is not an ordinary man, and it is wise to assume that there is a ""way of his own"", and this logic consists of from Two basic elements: The first is to confuse his opponents and weaken their morale, and the second is to distract their attention - such as carnivals in carnivals - until we turn our attention from real issues and we are busy with the illusion that is created.
The writer rejects the idea that Trump intends to send American forces to control Gaza and expel 1.5 million Palestinians by force, and he will not be able to force Jordan and Egypt to receive these Palestinians and resettle them permanently.
It shows that all these ideas are so far from reality and are so dangerous that it is unreasonable for this president - who says he wants to keep America outside wars and bring peace to the Middle East - to implement any of them.
The writer emphasizes the need not to fall into the trap, and focus on what is realistic and salt, noting, ""What I say is that instead of spending endless hours in analyzing his words, criticizing his plan or preparing to implement them (and this is exactly what he wants), we must ignore these statements And focus on the urgent issues facing us. ""

On what is important, the writer says: ""The fragile truce in Gaza must be preserved, and the parties must move to the second and third phases of them, This means continuing to pressure for Israel's withdrawal from Gaza, and to develop plans for reconstruction. ""
The writer also sees the need to pay attention to stopping the escalation of Israeli repressive violence in the West Bank and maintaining the focus on the need to hold Israel and the United States accountable for war crimes committed during the past fifteen months, he said.
President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to Zoghbi, want to frustrate the Palestinians and stir up chaos in the Arab countries, as they want to run out of time in the first stage of the ceasefire plan, and this would allow Netanyahu to resume his war to achieve what he calls ""victory Al -Kamil ""in Gaza, which ensures that its ruling coalition remains and its continuation of power.",UK
"
On the journalism tour on the fourteenth of February, we read several articles related to the policies of US President Donald Trump, from the displacement of the residents of the Gaza Strip outside the Strip and the customs fees that it imposes on the states of some of them is a major ally of the United States, in addition to the developments of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
We start this tour from an article published in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, in which the writer Jesse R. Weinberg suggested former US President Donald Trump to move Gaza population outside the Strip, noting that this idea is neither new nor innovative, but rather reflects a frequent pattern in dealing with the Palestinian issue.
He believes that the political repercussions of this proposal created a unified Arab front, but not necessarily in support of the Palestinians, but rather a refusal to assume the responsibility of their absorption, according to the writer's description.
Weinberg notes that Arab nationalism, despite its position on the Palestinian issue at the forefront of its political speech, has always dealt with the Palestinians as a political tool without a real practical commitment to them, as he put it.
But the writer believes that the Middle East today is completely far from the era of Arab nationalism, which reached its climax with Jamal Abdel Nasser, where the Arab countries were seeking to unify their political positions. With the collapse of Arab political nationalism after the 1967 war, the Palestinian issue became merely a political paper used to mobilize the masses, without a real desire to absorb the Palestinians or resolve their issue radically, according to the writer.
End proposed stories
The article indicates that Trump's plan soon was met with a wide Arab rejection, as it issued Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority a joint statement that opposes the strongly of this proposal. Weinberg believes that the Arab consensus here is not an expression of the support of the Palestinians as much as it is an affirmation of the refusal of the Arab countries to take responsibility for their resettlement.
Despite the categorical Arab rejection, Weinberg indicates that Trump's proposal may lead to a rethinking of the peace process, by pushing Arab countries to assume greater responsibility in the reconstruction of Gaza, and dealing with the issue of replacing Hamas as a ruling authority in the Strip.
But the writer criticizes Trump's vision of the Middle East as merely a major real estate deal, considering that this reflects a shortage of political understanding and geopolitical reality of the region. The real result of this plan was nothing but unification of the situation The Arab is against any idea to accommodate the Palestinians in neighboring countries.

It is worth the end
Weinberg believes that Jordan and Egypt are the most concerned about the consequences of this plan, given the serious political and economic pressures that may result in them, while Saudi Arabia may be the most controversial of Trump's plan, especially since the latter's administration was hoping to lead to the expansion of normalization (Abrahamic agreements (Abrahamic agreements ), Through an agreement to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, the writer says.
He continued that Trump revealed that the Saudis are no longer demanding a Palestinian state, which represents a fundamental shift from their old policy, according to his article.
The writer adds that the proposal of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to create a Palestinian state on Saudi lands increased complicated, pointing out that Riyadh was seeking to reduce its association with the Palestinian issue and focus on its strategic relations with Israel against the Iranian threat, he said.
However, the writer believes that Saudi Arabia will not completely abandon the Palestinians, given its position as an incubator For the sacred Islamic sites, as well as the aspirations of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the leadership of the Arab world.
Weinberg concludes that the Arab position on refusing to resettle the Palestinians has remained constant from 1982 until today, despite all regional political changes. For Arab countries, ""national stability"" remains more important than any commitment to the Palestinian issue, which reflects the gradual retreat from the idea of ??nationalism The traditional Arabic that was prevalent in the past.
To the Singaporean Street Times, and an article in which writer Andreas Claoth discusses how the slogan ""America first"" raised by US President Donald Trump in his second term, did not strengthen the power of the United States, but accelerated its international isolation.
He believes that Trump's political behavior and hostile moves towards the allies make America's hatred and isolation a matter more than surprising.
Klout notes that Trump promoted during his campaign for the idea that he will achieve peace through ""power"", claiming his ability to end Russia's war against Ukraine within 24 hours, and to prevent new conflicts, however, since his re -election and inauguration, Trump has taken a more hostile, replaced approach. Diplomatic discourse with ""political bullying"", as the writer described.
He explains that Trump has already threatened a number of countries, not only the traditional opponents but even the allies of the United States, as Denmark threatened to buy Greenland, pressed Panama because of its water channel, and waved to integrate Canada as a new US state, and practiced pressure on Colombia on receiving migrants, and considered a southern government Africa is hostile to eggs, and exerted pressure on Egypt and Jordan in an attempt to accommodate the people of Gaza after a plan ""The seizure of the ownership of the sector.""
Trump also imposed customs tariffs on commercial allies such as Canada, Mexico and the European Union, while he did not exert the same pressure on Russia and China, which raises questions about its actual strategy.
Klout believes that the countries did not stand idly by these transformations, but rather began to form new alliances that exclude the United States. Washington -led.

The writer notes that these moves reflect a fundamental shift in politics International, as countries no longer see in the United States the trusted leader, but rather are looking for new balance strategies that protect their interests away from American influence.
In his article, Klout adds that Trump, with his person, and his political movement, ""make America great again"", commit a catastrophic strategic mistake, by confusing the review of hostilities and actual leadership, while Trump sees that weakening the allies and pressing them will make America stronger, the reality indicates that that is that The United States isolates and pushes the world to search for a new balance that excludes it.
The writer warns that Trump's policy may eventually lead to ""alone America"", instead of ""America first"", a scenario that is already formed in front of our eyes.
In a related context, the British Guardian newspaper published an article by the writer Gabi Heinspiev discussing how US President Donald Trump, in his second term, no longer hides his inclinations towards giving up the allies, starting from Ukraine to Britain, which shows the true face of the policy of ""America first"" In practice.
The author notes that the release of Mark Fujel, the American citizen who spent three and a half years in a prison Russian because of the possession of marijuana, it was not just a humanitarian process, but rather a studied political message from Trump, according to which rapprochement with Vladimir Putin can bring positive fruits.
There were only a few hours of this deal until the new US Defense Secretary, Beit Higseth, in Brussels, began to set conditions for Ukraine's surrender, in what a former British Foreign Intelligence Service headed by MI6 as a ""golden opportunity for Putin"".
Hinspiev explains that the new American foreign policy is based on disengagement from Europe, focusing on China and protecting the American border. For the Trump administration, the Ukraine war must end, and what happens after it is the responsibility of Europe.
And she points out that all the previous calls that confirmed that Ukraine is a sovereign state that must decide its fate completely faded, after Trump communicated directly with Putin, and it seems that he made major concessions even before the start of official negotiations.
The writer adds that Trump believes that Russia should be allowed to keep some of the lands he seized by force, because ""Russia has lost many soldiers"", as if that justifies its aggression.
Hinslif also sees that this policy does not only mean a defeat Ukraine diplomatically, it even puts Britain in a very difficult situation. The world enters a new era of empires, where America, China and Russia wrestle with resources, markets and regional expansion, while Britain was left to face its reality alone.
The writer explains that Britain's success in foreign policy has always been linked to the power of the United States, but now it finds itself in front of a completely different reality, as the American commitment to Europe declined, the British army has become at risk, to the extent that British Defense Secretary Alestir Carenz recently warned that the British army It can be defeated within six months in a war similar to the Ukrainian war.
She adds that Britain has fully built its defensive strategy on the idea that the American forces will be able to bridge the gaps that London cannot deal with alone, but in light of the ongoing transformations, it seems that the United States is no longer a reliable ally, which means that Britain may have to increase Its defensive spending is unprecedented, even if it is at the expense of other priorities such as health services and education.
The writer notes that Trump's current policy has not surprised anyone, as There was enough time to prepare, but Britain and Europe chose to ignore warnings, and now, with the change of the international scene, Britain finds itself in a difficult position, between re -adapting to a new reality or facing the danger of geopolitical isolation.",UK
"Just 5 days after his return to the White House to start his second term, which ends in the beginning of 2029, the statements of US President Donald were blown up
Trump
By evacuating the Palestinians from
Gaza
The destroyed, a wide Arab and global controversy.
And last Saturday, after a call with Jordan's King Abdullah II, and while he is on the US presidential plane (E. Force One), Trump told reporters: ""I told him (the Jordanian monarch) I would like to receive more (Gaza residents), and I would like to receive
Egypt
Also people, we are talking about approximately 1.5 million people. ”
The next day, while he was in his resort in a role in the state of Florida, he said that he made an appeal similar to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah
Sisi
During a conversation between them on Sunday, that ""he would like Egypt to receive people and that Jordan receive people.""
Trump's statements, the strong supporter of Israel, who did not reveal Abdullah and Sisi's reaction, which coincided last Saturday, with his decision to release supplies of 2000 pounds of bombs for Israel, according to the ""Associated Press"", described by American writer David Ignatius, Monday. And an article in the ""Washington Post"", as ""like a hand grenade.""
""Does Egypt and Jordan compel?""
Although Trump, he called many crises, and made a battle with his ally in ""NATO"", Denmark on Greenland, and threatened to restore the ""Panama Channel"", and mocked Canada because of its commercial imbalance, but observers see that it will not exceed the statements, but in the Palestinian file It may seem serious.
""I think the Egyptian president will receive the Palestinians from Gaza, and the King of Jordan will do so,"" Axius reported on Tuesday.

This is despite the announcement of Jordan, through its foreign minister, Ayman Al -Safadi, the rejection of the proposal, and a statement of the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, confirms the rejection of the matter, and the Egyptian embassy in Washington, that ""Egypt will not be part of any solution that includes the transfer of the Palestinians to Sinai.""
The Associated Press asked, the question: Can Trump forced Egypt and Jordan to accept the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza to their lands? February by saying: ""This depends on the seriousness of Trump on this idea and how much he is ready to go to the farthest extent.""
In her published report on Monday, she confirmed that ""American customs duties are a favorite economic tool for Trump, or explicit sanctions may be devastating to Jordan and Egypt, as countries receive Billions of dollars in American aid every year, and Egypt is already mired in an economic crisis. ""
She indicated that ""allowing refugees to flow also may lead to destabilization"", and pointed out that ""Hamas and other armed groups are rooted in the depth of Palestinian society and are likely to move with the refugees, which means that future wars will revolve on Egyptian soil, and this would lead to disintegration Camp David's historical treaty for peace, which is the cornerstone of regional stability. ""
In the context, Trump's talk comes a day after his decision to suspend aid programs for foreign countries, except for Egypt and Israel.
This talk comes at a time when reports indicate a discussion that is taking place in the US Congress about Egypt's violation of the peace agreement with Israel by introducing forces and weapons unlike the text of the agreement, which some saw in an attempt to pressure Egypt on the other hand.
The Hebrew media, despite his celebration of Trump's statements, was a reading that emerged through the newspaper ""Yediot Aharonot"" in its editorial, stressing that ""from Trump's conversation with journalists we can know that the King of Jordan did not give a positive response but he did not want to neglect, apparently, apparently Because he feared who The anger of the American president. ""
But the newspaper, which welcomed the establishment of temporary refugee camps in the Sinai lands in the Rafah area and between Rafah and Al -Arish, described it as ""much more logical"", said that ""Sisi will not want to receive a million and more Palestinians in his country.""
Integrated scandal
Trump insults Sisi and underestimates Egyptian sovereignty on its soil.
He says that he will displace more than 1.5 million Palestinians and build housing for them inside the Egyptian and Jordanian borders as if he was talking about American land!

""Loss of confidence in Sisi""
Despite the Egyptian rejection, which is announced for the displacement, Egyptians via social media expressed their lack of confidence in Sisi, as it was excessive to Saudi Arabia on the islands of ""Tiran and Sanafir"" with the agreement to demarcate the maritime borders between the two countries in 2016, and its condolences for an area equivalent to the area of ??""Delta of the Nile"" in the economic zone For the Mediterranean, with its gas fields for Israel, Greece and Cyprus, and signing the 2015 agreement, Which Ethiopia enabled the construction of the Renaissance Dam, its condolences from large areas of land for the Emirates, and the sale of dozens of public companies, according to their saying.
The journalist writer Abdel Azim Hammad, expressed his concerns that the Egyptian public rejection will be another behind him in secret, recalling the saying of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to Trump once: ""Does he not care about what Arab officials publicly say on the Palestinian issue because they prefer whisper in the dark with their real positions."" .
In the face of the most important Egyptian and Arab topic, observers raised questions about Trump's statements and whether Sisi put in trouble between the anger of the army and the people, and the possible Egyptian army's position on any step that Trump and Israel might take for displacement, and the extent of the army's submission to Sisi, and his decisions.
On the other hand, some questioned the extent of Sisi's ability to refuse Trump's orientation and directives, especially with the financial cover, international support and protection of the Chair of the ruling to confront any internal movement, the consequences of Sisi's refusal, and the possibilities that Israel, the Zionist lobby and the White House will turn against him.
Activist and opponent Nasser Bakri, on the ""X"" website, referred to Al -Sisi's dilemma, with the Egyptian interior, if before the Trump proposal, And his impurity with the outside if he refused to displace.
If Sisi accepted Trump's suggestion
I will go from the inside
And if Sisi refused to propose Trump, he would go from abroad. I mean, it is like that, and it is not long

Activist Yahya Moussa said, ""Trump will pressure Sisi to pass the deal, and Sisi will be between the fear of Trump's anger that may overthrow him, and the fear of the army's grumbling that may meet with popular anger to topple him as well.""
He pointed out that ""the Egyptian army stood against the scenario of displacement, not for the sake of the Palestinian issue and all these slogans, but because the displacement means the imbalance of the security system in the Sinai and the opening of a resistance front, and then an Israeli intervention and involved Egypt in a confrontation.""
He emphasized that, according to information from Palestinian sources, """" Sisi was not objectionable to the displacement scenario; But he could not pass it, and this may have been a reason for the dismissal of the chief of staff, and the selection of a retired defense minister from outside the Military Council last July.
Al -Sisi said, during his reception of German counselor Olaf Schults, October 18, 2023, and 11 days after the ""Flood of Al -Aqsa"", the Palestinian bloody genocide war was erupted against 2.3 A million Palestinians in Gaza, ""The displacement of the Palestinians to Sinai means transferring the fighting to it and it will be a base to strike Israel,"" and indicated that they could transfer them to the Negev desert until Israel ends its operation in Gaza.
Al -Sisi said, in front of a crowd of army officers, that ""it will be easy to resettle some Palestinians in the Sinai, but the difficulty lies in persuading anyone in Egypt to accept the idea,"" some of which some saw acceptance of the idea and fear of the popular response.
""Farman exploits the situation of Egypt and Jordan""
In his reading of Trump's statements, the Egyptian journalist and political analyst residing in America, Mohamed El -Sattahi, told ""Arabi 21"" that ""Trump wants to exploit the unstable political and economic conditions to exert pressure on Egypt and Jordan.""
He added: ""But what Trump now asks is not just a tactical concession that can be possible in the framework of a balanced or even unbalanced deal. Rather, it lacks the basis for the concept of deals that Trump is proud of his ability to contract, as he now speaks the concept of imposing (his compassion) on others.""

Al -Satouti believes that ""the problem is that what he asks now means redrawing the borders of the region and its formation in the context of an extreme -right Israeli vision, and the response to it will inevitably lead to Show the stability of the countries of the region. ""
He expects, ""Therefore, there is a great resistance, especially at the popular level, and from the Palestinians themselves, and whom Trump deals with as a neglected that does not care about their desires and will, and believes that the possibility of imposing ethnic cleansing on them.""
The Egyptian journalist pointed out that ""Arab leaders should be strong in rejecting Trump's demands, as he used to say during his first term that he respects the powerful leaders; and he set examples of this in Vladimir Putin in Russia and Rajab Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey, and President Xi Jinping in China."" .
He stressed that ""trying to satisfy him (Trump) in diplomatic terms to avoid provoking it will explain it as a weak sign that he exploits to impose more pressures and concessions.""
Al -Sitti believes that ""despite the fragility of the Arab regime at this stage, I believe that they have an important paper that can be used,"" noting that ""Trump seeks to expand the Abrahamic agreements to include Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Gulf states and integrate Israel in the region.""
""Here, the Arab states must take a strong, coherent position that is not satisfied with the threat to suspend the normalization process; but also the negative impact on Israel's relations that are already existing with the countries of the region, so that it restores accounts The gain and loss of Trump and those who express them in Israel to their senses. ""
""Sisi's dilemma and 3 parties""
In his vision, the expert in political and strategic affairs, Dr. Mamdouh Al -Munir, said that ""Trump's statements about forced displacement of 1.5 million Palestinians from Gaza to Sinai or Jordan are not completely new, but rather are part of a long strategy to reshape the map of the region to serve Israeli interests."" .
Speaking to ""Arabi 21"", he explained that ""Trump talked about it previously as part of the deal of the century that he called for during his first presidency and Sisi responded at least at the time of the media, and she was part of it to exchange lands between Egypt and the Zionist entity, and the part that Israel will get From the Sinai, the Palestinians of Gaza are resettled in it.
He added: ""Then Trump talked about the issue again during his last election campaign when he said that the area of ??Israel on the map seems small and needs to increase it, and you do not need to be smart to understand that he intended to displacement to Sinai and Jordan, then finally these statements after assuming the presidency that puts Sisi Actually in a real dilemma between three main parties. ""
First: ""The anger of the Egyptian people known for their historical support For the Palestinian issue, and rejected any attempts to empty the Palestinian land from its residents, talking about the displacement of Palestinians to Sinai brings to mind ancient Israeli plans such as (Alon Project), which appeared after the occupation of Sinai in 1967, ""according to Al -Munir.
He stressed that ""any implicit approval of this plan will be considered a major betrayal of the Egyptian and Islamic national conscience and the size of popular anger over Sisi will increase, which threatens the stability of his rule.""
Second: ""On the military establishment, it is considered the file of displacement a real red line for it, and the national security motivation is not the reason for this, otherwise we would have seen something different from the military establishment in the file of waiver (Tiran and Sanafir) and (the Renaissance Dam) and other national security files Vitality.
The Egyptian researcher believes that ""the problem with the army, which works as a large holding company, is currently that the displacement does not only mean the transmission of the citizens of Gaza to Sinai, but the transfer of the Palestinian resistance with it to Sinai, which means that Sinai turns into a starting point for resistance against the Zionists with a great possibility to form an Egyptian popular incubator Big. ""
He continued: ""Therefore, the army loses its control over the Sinai, and it may be marked by a popular revolution against it. He can repel it or absorb it this time. ""
He continued: ""In addition to the fact that the resistance that has been unable and failed one of the strongest armies in the world and has the most powerful support of the world's armies, the Egyptian army will not be able to control it and it will be a losing battle for it by all standards.""
He believes that ""therefore accepting the idea of ??displacement is a direct threat to the stability of the Sisi regime in front of the military establishment, especially in light of the removal of prominent leaders such as the team Osama Askar, which may weaken the loyalty of the army to it and may turn against it.""
Third: ""Increasing Trump and Israel's pressure on Sisi a lot in the coming period. The conditions from a Zionist point of view are ideal for salvation from the headache of Gaza and the West Bank and will not find such an opportunity again, so they think, so economic and political pressure on Egypt will continue.""
Sisi catastrophic options
Al -Munir stressed, ""This is what will make Sisi in front of all options catastrophic for him,"" explaining that ""approval of the displacement means a clash with the army and may be an opportunity for the army to take it off and download it for the mistakes and disasters of the last period.""
He pointed out that ""if we assume that he was able to adapt the army and trim its nails to accept the deal at American Zionist pressure, the resistance will move to the Sinai and it will happen Natural communication between it and the Egyptian people and joining together, and the Sinai is inflamed, as well as if the army suppresses or resisted the Palestinian people, it will be an additional reason for the boiling of the Egyptian people and the explosion of the situation internally and it needs a signal only to ignite it due to the increasing economic pressures and the escalating political repression.
Show related news
He added: ""If Sisi rejects the displacement, it may be economically pressure on it to the maximum degree of what may lead to the collapse of the situation and the ignition of a revolution against him as well, and this can also be a possible scenario that Washington and Tel Aviv search for an alternative from within the army that can pass the displacement and use it to isolate Sisi and download all mistakes The past with a good price is in the form of economic aid to calm the street and pass the displacement at the same time. ""
He pointed out that ""some of the scenarios offered say that the displacement may not take place to Sinai for not attacking the entity and that it will be by integrating them into the Egyptian people, but that will have endless security risks as well, and Egypt may turn into a large incubator for the resistance and the system lives the same dilemma and perhaps worse."" .
He concluded by saying: ""Therefore, I am very optimistic that the effect of the Al -Aqsa flood will not stand at Gaza and Syria, but it will extend to Egypt soon Perhaps Jordan, as well, and the Arab peoples and their elites must prepare to seize opportunities as the Syrian opposition did, as opportunities are not repeated much and history respects only those who realize the jurisprudence of its time and place.",QA
"The West Bank has been the subject of an Israeli consensus since its occupation in 1967, in addition to its position in the ideological polarization of Zionist settlement, it represented a relative solution to the problem of poverty in the strategic depth of the nascent state, and directly after its occupation of the ""Haganah"", the workers' minister, Iagl Alon, his plan for the occupied Palestinian territories in general in general 1967.
The plan, which proposed to include the Gaza Strip and the displacement of its residents, adhered to areas of the West Bank, especially the Ghor region from the Jordan River to the eastern slopes of the Nablus and Jenin Heights, and the Hebron and Jerusalem regions, the restoration of the residents to Jordanian sovereignty, and linking them to the Hashemite Kingdom Signing the Oslo Agreement with a little, the explanation of the workers' Prime Minister, Isaac Rabin, explained The settlements in the West Bank are divided into security and political.
What the Israeli right, which is strengthened today, did the Teritan settlement movement, in the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, that he built on this Zionist colonial basis in nature. The strategic security, to maximize its settlement acquisition in order to pursue the major ""Israel"" from the sea to the river, which ascends the Palestinian demographic problem to the roof. What do the Israelis do with the original population bloc of the West Bank, which today has 3 million Palestinian people?!
The historic Israeli colonial policy pursues imposing and devoting facts, and making these facts the basis of the next step, whether it is proceeded to extend and exaggerate the colonial project, or it was a negotiating basis.
The Israelis, since their expansion in the Arab space in the year 1967, are making their resurrection the pillar of negotiations, neither the original rights of the indigenous people, nor international laws, no matter how unfair to the indigenous people, and thus the settlement project remained expanding in the West Bank with constantly increasing infrastructure, and with a military strength An Israeli accompanied by a feverish security stimulus, which began to turn The western bank is to an indigenous repulsive environment, attractive to colonial settlers.
The colonial state in the West Bank is characterized by growing policies and siege in its targeting of the indigenous people, taking a unique form of separation The racist, and the re -engineering of the meeting of the indigenous population, and that makes them in a fist applied for both settlement construction and military rule.
The settlement expansion, the colonial Jerusalem expanded and made it a huge bloc, separating the south of the West Bank from its north, and separating the indigenous population of the eastern Jerusalem inside the settlement wall from their geographical and demographic space in the West Bank, which created different conditions not only political among the residents of the east of Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank residents, But also economically and socially, which prevents social concert The economic and political between the Palestinians of Jerusalem and the Palestinians of the rest of the West Bank, and enhances the association of the Palestinians of Jerusalem with the Israeli Foundation.
The settlement construction represents the complex of colonial behavior in the West Bank. Diaphtalysts, the separation wall and the overall security system and security system, from barriers, iron gates, monitoring towers and cement cubes, serve the settlement movement, and fail the Palestinians' ability to move.
This added to the separation of the major Palestinian population blocs from each other, separating the villages from each other, and from their cities, which narrowed the vital field of Palestinian villages, To the extent that some Palestinian villages are closed to their people only, and the residents of the neighboring villages cannot reach, and this is in the permanent situation, while in the exceptional security conditions, as is the case since October 20, 2023, the number of closed villages increases with an iron gate.
Thus, the geography of the indigenous population turned into scattered pieces, besieging the active settlement life, and the pretty Israeli military forces, and in a way that facilitates its seizure, and makes it small, each of them, each of which has special circumstances, which breaks up the social unity of the Palestinians, and prevents the ability to build a comprehensive struggle for them.
At the same time, this siege isolates them from the areas of vital expansion for them, so there is no possibility to develop the agricultural sector to not be able to reach agricultural lands, and the occupation prevented the construction of any Palestinian building in the classified lands (C), and what is being built despite the occupation is vulnerable to demolition Having any opportunity to compensate the affected people.
While the administrative powers in areas (B) are supposed to be confined to the Palestinian Authority, according to the Oslo Agreement, ""Israel"" has finally decided to extend its administrative powers to areas (B) to include its ability to demolish What you want from the Palestinian buildings in this region.
The ability to isolation, control of roads, and the practical confiscation of regions (C), leads to destroying any ability to build a self -made Palestinian society connected to each other and is freed from Israeli economic hegemony, by executing the productive capabilities of the Palestinians, and restricted, in addition to what was mentioned, with the Paris Economic Agreement, which is subject to the economy The Palestinian entirely for Israeli control, a economy that has only outlets Israeli ports and crossings, which created the ""clearing"" crisis that ""Israel"" is in favor of the Palestinian Authority, in exchange for a commission it takes, and this collection has become a political extortion tool that it uses to impose political concessions and impose security conditions on the Palestinian Authority.
This clearing policy has ended in making the rentier ability of the Palestinian Authority fully linked to the will of successive Israeli governments, which took this wider with the government of Benjamin Netanyahu because its minister is Bazelil Smotrich, leader of the ""Religious Zionism"" party, a settler leader, and the leaders of the Torah settlement.
The continuous confiscation of the clearing funds entered the Palestinian economy in A permanent state of atrophy, as the Palestinian commercial session depends on the salaries of the authority’s employees, and the revenues of Palestinian workers who work in the territories occupied in 1948, and these revenues have almost stopped since October 7, 2023, after Israel prevented Palestinian workers from entering Jerusalem and the territories occupied in 1948.
This, in turn, indicates the lack of an opportunity to develop the agricultural and industrial economy in the West Bank, and the service economy is paralyzed by security conditions and cutting the West Bank in settlement and military, besides that a service economy cannot be developed only on the local population who lack economic certainty to attach their incomes to unstable salaries For the Palestinian Authority, or the wages of workers who are heading to work in The lands occupied in 1948.
It is clear by this that the logic of settlement inflation and its security needs imposed the transition from the policy of economic containment, to the policy of economic humiliation, and to serve the purposes of reducing Palestinian demography in the West Bank, which falls in the colonial solution to the problem of demography in all of Palestine, and enhances the projects of the annexation For the West Bank, and in the way that needs a gradual treatment for this problem.
In 2017, he submitted his plan to resolve the conflict in the West Bank, which requires the inclusion of the entire West Bank. This plan opens the discussion widely to the demographic problem, as ""Jewish Israel"" will not tolerate a Palestinian large number, so the solutions of Smotrich were raised, and escape from the dilemma of the apartheid, which may turn into the thesis of one state, represented in gradual steps:
Firstly; Dealing with the West Bank residents as a second -class population, without political rights, then facilitating voluntary immigration, then studying the granting of Israeli citizenship for those who accept full citizenship duties, including service in the Israeli army, and who refuses to recruit or immigration shall be punished with an unprecedented repression.
In the end, according to Smotrich's plan, the remaining residents of the West Bank are granted in a pattern of political deportation, provided that legal and security sovereignty remain on the West Bank of ""Israel"".
It is not necessary to say that this is a very ambitious plan, but all projects of annexation are out of their level, or security control, require reducing the numbers of residents of the West Bank. reducing The numbers of residents of the West Bank, and this situation, is a strategic, security, political and settlement need, and in this context the efforts of the settlement movement with the efforts of the official Israeli establishment join the efforts of the Israeli Foundation.
In addition to what was mentioned above, from a gradual path that led to the transformation of the West Bank into a repulsive environment, the settlement existence has evolved into the presence of an organized militia, in a number of settlement organizations, which are based on organizational structures, have their spiritual, ideological and political references, their religious, cultural and economic institutions, and their extensions In the Israeli institution, political, military and security, The entire battalions in the occupation army have become from the Teritan settlement stream, as well as the case in the police apparatus, especially the border guards.
It should be mentioned here that the second most important position in the occupation army, the commander of the central region, who is the military ruler of the West Bank, is occupied today by one of the religious settlers, and he is Avi Balout, who lived in the settlement of ""Nafah Tsouf"" based on the lands of some villages west of Ramallah, He studied at the Religious Military School in the settlement of ""Aili"", which is located on the lands of East Ramallah.
Representatives of the Teritan settlement stream in The government and the Knesset narrow the powers of the ""Shin Bet"" in following up the elements of the settler militias who were supervised by ministers in the Netanyahu government, such as Ben Ghaffir, the leader of the ""Jewish Great Party"", and this was reflected in horrific attacks, and more than ten years ago, as in the burning of the child Muhammad Abu Akhdar in 2014, and the Dawabshe family in 2015, then the attacks of the settlers continued, protected by the occupation army In raiding the Palestinian towns and cities, and deliberately destroying their property, and preventing them from reaching their agricultural lands to this day, without the Palestinians being able to possess the tools of defending themselves.
Slow displacement policies, its extent with the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, in terms of devoting the settlement presence and turning it into a permanent civil occupation, through the second ministry granted to Hemottic in the Israeli Ministry of War, so that the settlers have a management of their own within the ""Civil Administration"" military arm of military rule in West Bank.
The settlement administration is following a civil official with laws that are different from the military laws imposed on the Palestinians in the West Bank, in the endeavor to unify the laws of settlements with Israeli laws Inside the ground occupied in 1948, in the process of an actual annexation of settlements, and this in turn means more settlement inflation, and calls for more maid structures for the settlements, and requires more Israeli and military alert.
Also, slow displacement policies began to pursue steady and unprecedented violence, not only with the aim of accelerating the dismantling of armed rescue formations in the northern West Bank areas, but also with the aim of strengthening the repellent environment for the Palestinians, in a compound pattern of direct violence, as it occurs in systematic destruction in Jenin camps Tulkarm and others, the displacement of its residents, and from intimidation to the rest of the regions, which makes the future Dark and frightening, and pushes towards voluntary migration.
Some of the policies now existing to push for immigration are similar to what happened during the Nakba in 1948. The army is like ""Nicheh Yuda"", and the massacres of Deir Yassin and Al -Tanura, are repeated in various patterns in Tulkarm, Jenin and Smoun, And the war in the year 1948 is in the widespread military attack on the northern West Bank, but what is new is that this They are all based on a 58 -year -old settlement colonial structure, and to an entity that has huge ingredients for 77 years.

"""Surprisingly"", but it must be taken seriously. Thus, Middle East followers commented on February 5 on the plan of US President Tramalal, who wanted to implement it in Gaza, which is based on the displacement of hundreds of thousands of sector residents to other countries. A plan so far it seems to be a fantasy and unprecedented on the ground as well as it provokes a lot of opposition.
Trump reminds us of these similar statements, related to the inclusion of the ""Panama Channel"" and the ""Greenland"" Island of Denmark, and made Canada the US State No. 51 or send the dangerous American criminals to El Salvador. But all these suggestions collide with many obstacles.

For some specialists in international affairs, Trump's statements are not passing, but rather require the international community to raise and reject his voice because it represents a violation of international law. There are also many obstacles and barriers that prevent such a project. So Are these obstacles?
Donald Trump's project does not care much about the Palestinians' attachment to their land. The evidence for this is that there are more than half a million invaders who have returned to their destroyed homes north of the Strip once the ceasefire was announced.
In this regard, Dalal Erekat, Deputy Head of the International Relations Department and Assistant Professor at the Arab American League, said in a statement to France 24: He lives on her. ""

She added: ""During the past fifteen months, and despite all the genocide attempts by the occupied Israeli military forces, the Palestinian people stayed in their place and at home and did not leave.""
It is worth noting that Israel rejected several times the ""genocide"" of it by some countries, led by South Africa and international human rights organizations similar to Amnesty International.

For his part, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, said, ""Our land is our land,"" calling on Donald Trump to ""allow the Palestinians to return to their original homes in Israel because they are beautiful places.""
Dalal Erekat added that ""Trump's statement reflects a colonial thought that tries to impose a new reality on other countries by force in violation of international law. This was what he did during his first presidential term when he admitted Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in 2018 or when he admitted in 2019 that the occupied Syrian Golan is part of Israel.
And she added, ""His view constitutes an incitement to commit crimes and for the forced displacement of the Palestinian people,"" condemning the ""collective punishment"" that targets the inhabitants of Gaza and the Palestinians in general, ""noting that all these legal violations fall into the field of"" war crimes according to international law. ""
Most of the specialists in this regard who interacted with Trump's statements did not forget to emphasize the ""absurdity"" of such a legal proposal.

Tamer Morris, a specialist in international law at the University of Sydney in Australia, refers to this dilemma by saying, ""The United States cannot extend its control over the Blessed of Israel, which does not have the same right to waive the sector.""
""To the Palestinian Authority, it can be approved in the name of the Palestinian people, who has"" the right to self -determination, ""according to the specialist himself.
Even the speech that Trump uses is dangerous, according to Tamer Morris: ""The improvised method he talks about controlling the area and displacement of the population, suggests that these rules can easily violate and disrespect them.""
For its part, the United Nations stated last Wednesday that ""international law prohibits any forced deportation or deportation of residents living on occupied land.""
Dalal Erekat continues her speech to the international community: “It is time to work. Trump must be reminded that the first victim of instability in the Middle East is the Palestinian people themselves and that this people have rights. For this reason there will be no other“ ruralra ”in the Gaza Strip. .
Contrary to the idea that Donald Trump marketed, the The Arab countries reject its scheme altogether. While the Arab League condemned the ""violation of international law,"" noting that ""the project to displace the Palestinians is rejected by Arab and internationally.""
""It is possible that Trump will pressure some countries using the financial aid paper, especially against Egypt, whose part of its economy depends on the aid of the United States of America,"" added Maryam bin Raad, a professor of international relations at the Sheller International University.
She ended: ""Trump's scheme is not fully fake and not realistic as well. But at the same time it cannot be completely excluded due to the political turn that the new American administration can take at any moment.""
As for Hosni Abidi, director of the Arab World Studies and Research Center and the Mediterranean region in Geneva, he believes that the Trump proposal ""ends the two -state solution.""

He said: ""Talking about the draining of its inhabitants means erasing it from the entire map."" For him, there is only one solution to the problem, holding elections Palestinian, he says, ""I cannot understand why Trump wants to report instead of the Palestinians.""
Hosni Abidi believes that Donald Trump's comments on Gaza are greatly derived from the comments of his son -in -law Jared Kushner when he was responsible for the Middle East file during the first presidential term of Trump.
""The Gaza Strip must be cleared and a new and prosperous area must be built,"" Kushner had always said. A year ago, Kushner shocked a lot with his remarks when he said that ""Gaza will give it large economic and tourism ingredients that can be exploited and developed when its residents are transferred to another place.""

What is Hamas's position on all this? Although it weakened 15 months after the war, Hamas is able to carry out a violent street war in order to thwart the Trump scheme.
While a European diplomat in Jerusalem did not reveal his identity, that ""the Trump plan in Gaza contradicts his slogan"" America first "", adding that the American president"" believes that things will go Smoothly and Engtasha, we seek Iraq, and believes that it will convince them, and this is the worrying thing. ""
Caution and anticipation are the prevailing of the Israeli political class. As for the extreme right, it is ""happy with the Trump scheme and shared by it.""
For their part, moderate deputies thanked Trump, but at the same time they expressed their reservation about the feasibility and effectiveness of his plan for the Gaza Strip. ""The Israelis cannot expect to renounce Tram, not to get out of the crisis,"" said the opposition leader, who can expect them to get a tram, not to get out of the crisis. ""
This means that ""Trump's scheme is not implemented and useless,"" according to Hosni Abidi. The latter ended: ""Trump is a businessman. He tries to involve and enter the game all the countries of the region in order to get out of the direct conflict and the two -year -old between the Palestinians and Israel.""

We review today's newspapers a number of opinion articles that focus on the situation in the Middle East, including an article on the threats facing the collapse of the agreement to stop the fire agreement between Israel and Lebanon because of Trump's support for Netanyahu's plans, and an article about the challenges facing the Lebanese Hezbollah and its activity after cutting lines Iranian supply, and finally an article wondering whether Lebanon is on the threshold of the end of a historical war and another beginning that I will not reduce Problem.
We start our tour from the British newspaper ""The Guardian"" and an opinion article written by Muhammad Bazzi, entitled ""The Truch of Lebanon and Israel's fragile truce at stake due to Trump"", the writer consumes it by indicating that the ceasefire agreement between Lebanon and Israel remains threatened with collapse, amid a global interest only on the exchange of hostages and prisoners Between Hamas and Israel.
The writer says that the agreement, which was concluded with American mediation in late November, stopped a 14 -month war between Israel and Hezbollah, and paved the way to end years of political stalemate in Beirut, after Lebanon formed a new government, and finally he had leaders chosen Based on their commitment to implementing reforms, Instead of their sectarian affiliations, the future of the ceasefire agreement placed them in front of a direct dilemma.
The writer notes that, according to the agreement, Israel was supposed to withdraw its entire forces from the areas it invaded in southern Lebanon in October, while Hezbollah agreed to transfer its fighters and its weapons to the north of the Litani River, and the withdrawal of both parties would allow the army. Lebanese spread in southern Lebanon.
Despite the withdrawal of Israel from Lebanese towns and villages, it kept its forces in five strategic locations in southern Lebanon, giving them important observation points, and although Israeli officials describe this as a ""temporary deployment"" of the forces inside Lebanon, the matter represents an occupation of Lebanese territory And it may lead to the collapse of the ceasefire agreement.
End proposed stories
The writer says that the capabilities of Hezbollah were greatly weakened in its recent war with Israel, which resulted in the assassination of most of its prominent leaders and the destruction of most of its military arsenal, but that, according to the writer's opinion, Israel may risk exaggeration in exploiting its military victory, especially in light of the United States' inability to Check Netanyahu and prevent him from prolonging The Israeli war in Gaza and expanding its scope to Lebanon, after Israeli press reports spoke about the success of the Netanyahu government in persuading the administration of the US President, Donald Trump, to allow Israel to maintain a ""long -term"" military presence in southern Lebanon.
The writer believes that if Israel continues to occupy areas of Lebanon, with the support of Trump, it will not only face the danger of renewing the conflict with Hezbollah, but will also strike a severe blow to the new Lebanese leadership.
The writer notes that the continuation of the Israeli occupation of Lebanese territory, even if Israel sought to portray it as a defensive measure to protect its residents in the border areas, would thwart the efforts of the new Lebanese leaders before they have the opportunity to address the deep economic and social crises that have been rooted in the country since Long years.
The writer concludes his article, pointing out that the task of rebuilding the economy, and the areas destroyed by the recent war with Israel, represents a challenge to the new Lebanese government, which found itself in a situation that necessitates preserving a fragile truce, and staying as a strong rider to preserve the country's borders.

It is worth the end
We turn to the American newspaper ""Washington Post"" and an opinion article written by Muhammad Shamaa, Suzanne Hidamus and Abe Cesiman entitled ""Hezbollah faces financial pressure after cutting the Iranian supply lines"", which writers consume by referring to the imminent financial crisis of Hezbollah after the interruption of traditional financing lines from Iran .
Analysts say that the United States, Israel and the new rulers of Syria, who toppled the Syrian President, Bashar al -Assad, the ally of Hezbollah, have stressed the screws on the sources of financing the Lebanese armed group and its supplies with weapons.
""The restriction of Iranian flows put the group (Hezbollah) in a difficult position,"" said analyst Sam Heller, of the Century Foundation.
The author of the article believes that at the internal level, Hezbollah has become increasingly marginalized by its political opponents, who took advantage of its setbacks, which made the party unable to prevent the election of Joseph Aoun, the former commander of the Lebanese army and the favorite of the United States, as President of the Republic, as the party was unable On the prevention of the nomination of Nawaf Salam, a former judge of the International Court of Justice, for the position Ministers.
The article indicates that the stifling financial crisis facing the party may represent the most dangerous threat to its existence. Last week, the Lebanese authorities prevented an Iranian plane from landing in Beirut, amid Israeli accusations that Tehran is using trade trips to smuggle funds to the armed group, and the new Syrian government also started a strict campaign against the smugglers linked to Hezbollah, along the eastern border of Lebanon, which led to The outbreaks of clashes and increased tensions between the two countries, according to the article.
Heller notes that these measures directly targeted Hezbollah, indicating that the Syrian government focuses on undermining the party that supported Assad during most years of the Syrian civil war.
The article believes that Hezbollah will seek to show its strength during the funeral ceremony of the former years of the two years, Hassan Nasrallah and Hashem Safi Al -Din, on Sunday, as the party hopes to mobilize tens After the war.
Hilal Khashan, a professor of political science at the American University of Beirut, says that Hezbollah does not have enough financial resources to return The reconstruction of its affected regions, so it will need external support, adding that the party will face a more difficult financial situation in the absence of the direct supply of Iran.
The article notes that one of the members of Hezbollah familiar with the affairs of the group said that the party still has money at the present time, but the matter is not certain in the long term, and added that the restrictions imposed on transferring money through the airport or by land from Syria, greatly impedes its operational capacity And the efforts to reorganize its ranks. He also pointed out that Lebanese banks reject financial transfers from party supporters abroad, for fear of violating the US sanctions imposed on their financial activities.
The article concludes with a sign of a growing sense of despair among the supporters of Hezbollah, while others see that they may need the party's support for a longer period than they expected under these difficult circumstances, with certainty that ""Hezbollah will not let us down.""

We conclude our tour of the London newspaper, Al -Sharq Al -Awsat, and the opinion article written by Iyad Abu Shakra, entitled ""difficult hours on Lebanon ... and perhaps on the region"", the writer consumes it by indicating that Lebanon is going through critical hours. Lebanon has been seen. February 2005, and says if these hours pass in peace, the Lebanese are promised to a mysterious and unnecessary period.
The writer believes that the ""chemistry"" of the region is changing and ""its Muslims"" is falling in front of our eyes faster than we were expecting, describing the ""setback"" that the Iran project in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria was exposed to as a ""harsh setback"", adding that at a time when local crowds are exposed to And the expatriate of both the two former years of the two years of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah and Hashem Safi al -Din, This is likely to be the end of a historical stage and another start that will not be reduced.
The writer explains that the problematic lies here that there are no indications of the conviction of the party leaders, its popular base, or its regional sponsorship, by the impossibility of coexistence between the militia weapons and the ""state"" existing in countries that are supposed to be independent such as Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.
The writer says that the party that caused the harsh setback to Hezbollah, and from behind Iran, is an Israeli authority that is exhausted in its extremism, hatred and rejection of any real peace that establishes a viable coexistence. It was, in Lebanon or in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, I have always bet on extinguishing the moderate national voice and weakening the chances of the state, and in The opposite, the party turned a blind eye to the rise of the hard -line alternative in order to provide it with the pretext of escaping from the entitlement of a fair peace, according to the writer.
The writer adds that ""the current Israeli extremist authority does not only enjoy absolute support from the Republican leadership in Washington, but we also saw how this leadership went far away in encouraging Likodi Israel and its settlers over their displacement projects in Gaza, then today in the West Bank.""
The writer believes that amid the continuous Israeli escape forward, the accelerating American executive orders, and the European and Atlantic confusion that were caused by Washington's recent positions regarding Ukraine and Canada and global trade, the international community itself is unable to absorb the repercussions of what is happening.
The writer notes that the regional and international atmosphere led to the emergence of a state of cautious Arab anticipation regarding what the days bear, while trying to maintain the amount of the initiative as to what affects joint security, the Palestinian right and alleviate the excessive savings issued by a number of influential players. Perhaps the recent Arab initiatives constitute an opportunity not only to stop the slipping towards the unknown, but also to agree on common denominators Its effects continue until after the current stage of tension and doubts.
The writer Iyad Abu Shakra concludes his article, pointing to the need for Arabs to have the minimum real understandings to confront the upcoming regional storms, and at the top of these storms disturbing the Israeli ambitions, the expected reaction from Iran over the last two years, and the potential Turkish role after Ankara contributed to its achievement In the Syrian arena and what I did not hint on on the Palestinian arena.",UK
"a statement
location
The British ""Middle East Eye"", that Jordan is ready for the war if the Palestinians are forced to migrate to its lands.
The site quoted informed sources in Amman and Jerusalem as saying that the last thing Jordan wants is the war, and it is keen to reach a peaceful solution, but they insist that the Jordanians will close the border if the refugees start crossing the country.
One of the sources said: ""If the Israelis seek to reopen it, then this will be a reason for war.""
This warning comes in the wake of repeated statements by US President Donald Trump, that he would like to see Jordan and Egypt to receive the Palestinians as part of the move towards ""cleansing"" a sector
Gaza
.
Below is the text of the report:
Middle East learned that if a president tries
Ministers Benjamin Netanyahu forcibly expelled the Palestinians to Jordan, Jordan is on
Ready to declare war on Israel.
This warning comes after repeated statements
US President Donald Trump will want to see Jordan and Egypt to absorb the Palestinians
As part of a move aimed at ""cleaning"" the Gaza Strip.
In comments to Middle East Eye, sources said
Informed and with a prominent position in Jordan, the last thing Jordan wants is War, and it is eager
To see a peaceful solution. But she emphasized that the Jordanians will close the border if it started
Refugees cross the country.
And if the Israelis tried to reopen it, then
This will be a legitimate reason for the outbreak of the war, as one of the sources said.
Jordanians do not fancy that they are able to win
The war with Israel, but they believe that they have no choice but to fight.
Jordan had been sent by additional brigades to
Its western borders, after not ambiguity, issued by Oman, that it will consider any attempt
To force the Palestinians to cross the border as a blatant violation of the peace treaty that
The country was concluded with Israel in 1994.
Israel responded with the formation of a new eastern corpse to protect
The border with Jordan.
In a statement to Middle East Eye, someone said
Sources that
Trump's proposal
It is considered an ""existential issue"" for Jordan and for the scale
The Hashemite alike, indicating that Oman is the third poorest country in the world in terms of
Water.
The most of Jordan's population, who is numbered
Twelve million people, in a narrow strip of land along the Israeli border, soon
From the Jordan River. The country cannot simply accommodate the flow of large numbers of Refugees,
According to the sources.
Jordan Red Line
Perhaps the Israelis, with their superiority
Huge in military resources, we are able to achieve a rapid traditional victory, but they will find
They are forced to defeat and install a sprawling area with an open desert border to
the East.
The Israeli border with Jordan extends for four hundred
A kilometer, that is, the full country, which is ten times longer than the Israeli border with Gaza. majority
The border area is mountainous and rugged, and in some of its parts it is impossible to control it security.
This increases the opportunity to launch a campaign of guerrilla warfare
The extended, such as those that eventually led the Americans out of Iraq and from
Afghanistan. Certainly, this will attract fighters from Syria, Iraq and the Kingdom
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries, as Jordan has a desert border
Open on the eastern side.
Jordan has remained, and for many years, it provides
Stability on the East Israel border - a stability that will disappear between the eve
Overland if the war erupted.
However, a while ago and the relations between the two countries
Cold. The Jordanian government did not hide its growing dismay towards the attack on Gaza, and a wave
Attacks Watching the settlers, and the ethnic cleansing practiced in the West Bank.
Shortly after the outbreak of the conflict in Gaza in
October 2023, Jordan King Abdullah announced that:
It relates to the issue of the coming of refugees to Jordan ... that is a red line. ""
However, Trump announced last week that he had spoken
With King Abdullah and he said to him: ""I would like you to take more"", as part of a plan
""Cleaning"" 1.5 million people from the Gaza Strip.
During meetings he had with European officials
In Brussels on Wednesday, King Abdullah reiterated, ""Jordan's opinion, which is not budging about
The necessity of enabling the Palestinians in their land and obtaining their legitimate rights, according to the two -state solution.
Also, the Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Al -Safadi said
On Monday, ""Any discussion about the alternative homeland of the Palestinians is rejected.""
The situation increased complicated after Trump rose
By cutting aid from Jordan. There are fears that the American president may make acceptance
Jordanian, Palestinian refugees, as a condition for resuming aid. There is an additional complex
About the presence of American residents inside Jordan.
The influx of refugees would be with balance
Ethnic embarrassment in the country. More than two million Jordanians are registered As Palestinian refugees. some
Other estimates increase in the number that may even include the majority of the population.
Lack of stability and ethnic conflict
The rapid flow of refugees led to Jordan during
The Nakba in 1948 and then again in 1967 to September in 1970, when
The Hashemite dynasty crushed the Palestinian factions that are afraid of their endeavor to seize
The state.
The sources say that Jordan is afraid to pay a flow
Refugees to renew the civil conflict. If we take into consideration that the residents of Jordan feel
Anger over the conflict in Gaza, refugees coming from Gaza and the West Bank can
They are an additional factor for instability.
In a meeting held on Saturday in Cairo, he refused
Diplomats from Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
And Qatar is any forced displacement of the Palestinians.
These countries said in a joint statement: ""We confirm
We rejected any attempts to digest the rights of the Palestinians, both through activities
Settlement, expulsion, land inclusion, or by emptying the land from its owners ... with any
Figure and under any circumstances or justifications. ""
Trump's export to the Palestinians to the Palestinians
Jordan had previous copies of time At least to the so -called Alon plan, which
It was called the Israeli politician Yigal Alon, who called after the 1967 war to include most
West Bank.
Also, the Hashemites are the shepherds of the holy places
Islamic and Christianity in Jerusalem. The sources say that any move aims to demolish the dome of the rock or
Al -Aqsa Mosque in preparation for building the third Jewish structure - a goal that many have been
The right -wing extremist groups in Israel - may be a good reason for the outbreak of war.
What anxiety is that even Higseth's house, a minister
The new defense in the Trump administration, demanded a recklessness to establish the third Jewish structure in the same

"On February 4, Atharbunald Trump, during his reception of Israeli Prime Minister, Deninamine Netanyahu, a visit to Washington, a wave of discontent in the Arab world is surprised in the entire world. This is after he proposed an unprecedented plan to displace all residents of the Gaza Strip to Jordan and Egypt. This is following a fifteen -month war between Israel and Hamas, which was almost completely destroyed by the Strip.
According to Trump's plan, Egypt and Jordan should receive the Palestinian residents of Gaza, but both countries refused to do so.
When Trump was asked on January 30 about how to persuade Cairo and Oman to receive the Palestinian deportees, he simply answered and confidently: ""They will do that, right? We are doing a lot for them, and they will do that.""
Trump was alluding to US aid to these two countries, according to several cooperation agreements, after my peace treaties with Israel signed by Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994.

Although Trump's proposal is included in the forced displacement field, a war crime prohibited by international agreements, the most prominent of which is the Geneva Convention, except for The Israeli government showed its interest in this proposal that it is seriously dealt with.
Even Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz has instructed the armed forces to work to facilitate the ""voluntary departure"" of the Gaza population. Benjamin Netanyahu also rushed to describe this proposal in a tweet on the X site as ""the wonderful idea that must be studied carefully.""
The American administration has always committed for several decades to establish a Palestinian state that includes the Gaza Strip as a major part of it, despite the permanent refusal of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to this proposal.
The United States had previously expressed its opposition to any forced displacement of the Palestinians from Gaza or from the West Bank. The Biden Administration Minister, Anthony Blakenn, stated last year that ""it is not possible, and the Palestinians should not be forced to leave Gaza."" However, this American position appears to be on the way to change and in a way that will not satisfy the Palestinians ... nor the neighboring countries.

Today, more than two million Palestinian refugees, according to the United Nations, live in Jordan, numbers Great of them from obtaining Jordanian citizenship. Thousands of Palestinians also resorted to Egypt with the beginning of the war with Israel, but the Egyptian authorities do not recognize them as refugees there.
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi stated in October 2023 that he refuses any forced displacement of the Palestinians to the Sinai Peninsula, and that the only solution is to establish an independent state for them.
Although the American administration was somewhat corrected by this proposal, officials explained that there is no idea an American spread in this sector or a permanent displacement of the Gaza population.
However, the idea of ??temporary displacement of Gazans pending the rehabilitation of the devastating sector is still on the authority, despite the absence of any data on a schedule for that. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who will take place after his first visit to the Middle East after assuming the position, said that the Palestinians will have to ""live elsewhere temporarily"" during the reconstruction of the sector.
But Trump answered a question about the Palestinians' right to return by saying, ""No, they will not have the right to do so because they will get much better housing."" ""I am talking about building a permanent place for them,"" he added, noting that the Gaza Strip will take years to become good To live again.
Although Cairo and Oman rejected this Donald Trump's plan, the ability of the two countries to oppose Donald Trump may be limited. This is because both depend on the American economic and military aid to ensure their security, social and economic stability.
Jordan is one of the four countries receiving the largest amount of American aid in the world, as Jordan benefits from $ 1.4 billion annually as bilateral aid from Washington.
While Egypt receives $ 1.3 billion as military aid as part of the Camp David agreements.
However, this aid is not sufficient to counter the continuous economic difficulties in both countries, which means it is difficult to dispense with them.
In 2024, Egypt miraculously avoided the economic collapse after benefiting from $ 50 billion aid granted by the European Union, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the United Arab Emirates. Then the Egyptian foreign debt exceeded 152 billion dollars. Egypt is the only ally of Washington, with the exception of Israel, who obtained an exemption from the freezing of American aid announced by Donald Trump. It was not the case for Jordan.
On Although the economic situation in Jordan is less worrying, Oman depends on international aid to maintain the country's balance, as 70% of foreign financing has been allocated to support the state budget.
""The United States is one of the most prominent donors of Jordan militarily or in terms of social and economic assistance,"" says Jalal Al -Husseini, from the French Institute for the Near East in Amman. It is believed that this situation would ""be one of the factors that Washington will use to push Jordan to accept a certain number of Gaza population immediately.""
Dr. Gilad Winig, who is studying at the University of California in Los Angeles, says the American administration has started financial pressure on Egypt from the first days of the Israeli attack on Gaza. He explains that ""Egyptian reports indicated that Washington offered financial incentives to Cairo, including the possibility of alleviating debt burdens, in exchange for accepting this Gaza population's displacement plan, which Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi was said to have strongly rejected it."" He pointed out that these reports were never confirmed. But on the Egyptian side, this news may allow the government to reaffirm its position and photograph President Sisi as a strong defender of Palestinian rights. ""
But to sacrifice the United States, with its Egyptian and Jordanian allies, that would cause serious consequences, especially at the security level, as about 3,000 American soldiers have spread in Jordan since the beginning of the war in Syria. In October, Jordan participated alongside Americans in intercepting a series of Iranian missiles that were launched on Israel. The United States has also trained and equipped the Egyptian army for more than 30 years, making the country a strong security partner for Washington.
And if Egypt insists on considering that the forced displacement of the Gazans would become a threat to its national security, then it tries to avoid turning its lands into a rear base to launch attacks against Israel.
Jalal Al -Husseini believes that Trump cannot be predicted to force his allies to accept his plans on Gaza, especially since this proposal is consistent with Trump's pro -Israel policy during his first presidential term.
In 2019, Trump's son -in -law Jared Kushner, who was the special envoy of the Middle East at the time, managed to put forward an idea of ??peace in Gaza based on economic development and the normalization of relations between countries Arabic and Israel.
""During his first presidency, Trump was seen as a destabilization factor in the region because of his support for the Israeli settlement policy. The Gaza population's deportation plan today seems to be an extension of his vision of the future of the Middle East,"" says Jalal Al -Husseini.",FR

Jordan sent indirect responses to the American administration through the statements of Foreign Minister Ayman Al -Safadi, last Sunday, who said that the establishment of the Palestinians on their soil is a fixed Jordanian position that did not and will not change, and that the solution of the Palestinian issue is in Palestine, Jordan for Jordanians and Palestine for the Palestinians.

Options for facing Trump's scheme to displace the Gazans
Regarding the Jordanian reactions that are required to confront the Trump scheme, the displacement of the Gazans said, the deputy of the Islamic movement said, "" For ""Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed"", Trump runs the affairs of the region with his commercial mentality as if they are deals that he can solve by a phone call, indicating that the American support for the occupation state is a great danger to Jordan, and just the statement that the Palestinian issue can be resolved by displacing the Palestinians to Jordan, this requires tools to be changed The traditional in dealing with this file, adding: The concerned authorities must increase their language and procedures in this regard, and from it To wave the abolition of the Wadi Araba agreement (the Jordanian -Israeli peace treaty), especially in light of the useless normalization with the occupied entity.
Freihat called for unifying the internal front with practical procedures that relieve the street and stack the ranks of the Jordanian interior, and study preparations to confront this decision, especially since the official Jordan previously described the attempts to displace as a declaration of war on Jordan. He added: ""We have to dispense with American aid forever, study the investment of economic resources for Jordan, and to qualify young people by re -serve the flag (compulsory recruitment) and their inclusion in the popular army.""
He pointed out that ""the position of Jordanian foreign policy is good, but we aspire to what is greater through coordination to support Arab And Islamic for Jordan, and holding urgent meetings for the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic States, and most importantly, taking a supportive position of the resistance in Gaza and the Palestinian people there, and the lack of boycott with Hamas, which has a major role in stabilizing the Palestinians in Gaza, ""considering that the scene of the return of the Palestinians from the southern Gaza Strip To the north, they show their insistence and their attachment to their land.

Nabil Gishan: We have to obtain a decision that prevents the reception of refugees, and it is binding on the government
Gishan saw that Trump's leakage of what he is thinking about Gaza through his call with King Abdullah II made the response easier than it if it came within the framework of a specific American plan that imposes certain items on the countries of the region, and he received a direct response from everyone, and what strengthened the Jordanian and Egyptian response. Al -Bushra returns the Gazans to their places of residence, from south to north. He reminded the Turkish refusal to use the Incirlik base in the coalition against Iraq after issuing a decision by the People's Assembly, noting that ""Jordan's position is a government and our parliament is clear, but we have to obtain a decision that prevents the reception of refugees, and it is binding on the government and prevents retreating from it.""

He believed that ""Trump, his orders, instructions, and wishes are not a destitute for our Arab peoples, but the confrontation of this is not required from a state alone, but this is a national and Islamic work in order to preserve the interests of Arabs and Muslims"", wishing urgent coordination between Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar to launch a project Arabic for a rational and acceptable solution in the region, avoiding it to repeat wars, destruction and blood.

He considered that it is possible to make proposals An alternative, and presented his point of view that rejects displacement directly and clearly to the American administration, and the risks of the American administration from the risks of regional security and stability, and that resolving the issue in this way is the recipe for an explosion in the near future, and it has effects on the stability of the region, although the cost is Facing this is very high. He added that Jordan must also prepare the Interior Front for that if it wants to confront the plans of the American administration at the level of review of economic and internal policies as a whole and arrange its priorities, in addition to carrying out a major diplomatic campaign that begins in coordination with Egypt and the countries concerned as well as the western countries that share its point of view, in addition to international organizations.

Khaled Shinikat: The American administration may exert all pressure on Jordan and may be gradual and accelerated
Shenikat pointed out that the refusal of the displacement of the Palestinians is an initial position during the past decades, which is an extended position for the Jordanian state. Jordan rejects any attempts to displacement to liquidate the Palestinian issue at his expense, explaining that King Abdullah II has declared openly, clearly and in the form He continues to reject any displacement, and that the Palestinian issue is resolved in Palestine and not at the expense of Jordan. He believed that the Trump administration is determined to implement this issue, and it will pressure strongly in this direction, and this will only stop the steadfastness of the Palestinians in their land, indicating that the statements calling for the displacement of the Gazans are not only by Trump, but all the pillars of his administration, most notably the statements of the American ambassador to Israel Mike Hackabi , Who talked about canceling the term West Bank and replacing it with ""Judea and Samaria"", which means that these lands Jewish and settlements are cities and gatherings and must remain so.
According to Shinikat, Trump does not care about the reactions of others or to take any side considerations into account, reminding the decision of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, as he does not establish any weight for any reaction and believes that the Arabs will not be able to reject his decisions. He pointed out that the majority of the leaders of the Republican Party believes that resolving the Palestinian issue will be at the expense of Jordan and to a lesser degree Egypt and some Arab countries. He continued: In the event that Jordan rejects, the American administration will exert all pressure and may be gradual and accelerated, and it may start with a review of aid and restrictions on the arrival of Jordanians to The United States, especially at the official level, and perhaps cut ties, not only with Jordan, but also Egypt. He indicated that all the options are difficult. In the event that Jordan accepts the transfer of the Gazans, the scenario itself will be repeated in the West Bank, and its inhabitants were transferred to Jordan, and here may be liquidating the Palestinian issue, and even doing so will include real risks to internal security and even the region.

""Reproduction for the Century Deal""
The Jordanian academic Badr Madi, Professor of Political Sociology at the German -Jordanian University, said that Trump's statements are not a new proposal, but rather renovated, which is a cloning of the ""Deal of the Century"" project, which was revealed in its first era.
Madi, in an interview with ""Arabi 21"", he said that Trump always wants to alleviate the Israeli right -wing government, and plays with the ""demographic bomb"" paper that Israel always fears, and seeks to confront it with expansionary settlement projects.
Madi pointed out that Trump's statements came shocking to two countries (Jordan and Egypt), after they were made everything they could to try to stabilize the region.
He pointed out that Egypt faced the pressures of the displacement of Gazans to its territory for 15 months, and it has already succeeded, preventing the emptying of the sector from its residents.
Confronting options
Badr Madi pointed out that Jordan will face with full force any proposal to displace the Palestinians to the Kingdom, or even to Egypt, even if This was linked to his external aid.
He explained that Jordan has excellent relations in the deep American institutions, whether in the army or Congress, and will do a hard and painful diplomatic work, and will throw its diplomatic weight, in an attempt to correct the misconceptions of Donald Trump.
Madi said that Trump appears to ""do not understand the reality of interlocking relations in the region, and he does not have a real reading of the population's connections with their lands, their fate and their national identity, whether Palestinians, Jordanians or Egyptians.""
He explained that Jordan must move first bilaterally with Egypt, then a triple with Palestine, to confront the project that Trump spoke about.

Required from neighboring countries
The Secretary -General of the Jordanian Labor Party, and the parliamentary deputy, wars, said that the Jordanian government should persuade the Gulf states, especially Saudi Arabia, not to respond to Trump's desire to invest in the United States, unless the latter agrees to declare an independent Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital.
Wars indicated in an interview with ""Arabi 21"", that the Arab countries are required to stand with the Palestinian people, and to contribute to the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip.
She continued that countries The Gulf, especially Saudi Arabia, has large pressure papers on the Trump administration, and the Israeli right -wing government, and the most important paper is that the Kingdom does not join the ""Abraham"" normalization agreements with the occupation, and the countries involved in it waving to withdraw from them.
Openness is required
Rali Al -Hroub said that the situation requires the government an internal and externally open openness, which is to unify the inner class, give a space for freedoms, and to abandon the approach of security restrictions, in addition to stopping all forms of security coordination with the Israeli occupation.
She added that the required external openness is to coordinate with the European Union, adding: ""He suffers from Trump's persecution, and he will pay a high price in his years of rule.""
She pointed out that it is necessary to consider coordination with the rest of the world affected by Trump's policies, and the formation of a global front opposing its policies, similar to the ""Non -Aligned"" bloc during the era of former Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser.
She pointed out that coordination must expand to include major Islamic countries, such as Türkiye, Iran, Pakistan, Malaysia, and Indonesia, in order to declare unified positions against the Trump project.
Capable
On the aid issue The Foreign Ministry, and the possibility of using it as a extortion card by the American administration, Badr Madi said that Jordan is able to abandon aid despite the cost of this on its economy.
He added: ""Jordan did not get aid in recent years from the Arab siblings, and matters have though very much to the minimum.""
He explained that ""American aid is important, whether for civil society or the Jordanian state, but it can be dispensed with, even if it has caused great difficulties in the financial and economic structure of the Jordanian state, and it will have an impact in the coming years.""
He stressed that ""Jordan can come out with the least losses, especially if it faster the success of the project of a Jordanian -Turkish -Turkish coalition in trade and industry.""

A red line developed by the king
The Jordanian monarch, King Abdullah II, in several statements during the past years, rejected the rejection of any plan to displace the Palestinians to the Kingdom.
The last of these statements was last September, as he expressed his rejection of what he ""promoted"" to him who called ""the extremists"" in Israel for the idea of ??turning Jordan as an ""alternative homeland"" for the Palestinians, saying that ""this will never happen"", and described the process of ""forced displacement "" For the Palestinians as a ""war crime"".
The king added in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, that ""for years, the Arab world extended his hand to Israel through the Arab Peace Initiative, ready to recognize it and normalize relations with it, in exchange for peace, but the successive Israeli governments have chosen the confrontation, as a result of the immunity they gained over years in The absence of any deterrent to her.

"The words of US President Donald Trump about the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip still interact, the last of which is what the Israeli Channel 12 spoke of, last Wednesday, that there are three regions of Trump's thinking about the transfer of Gaza residents to it, which are the Puntland and Somalland region (or the unrecognized separatist land region of Somalia International) and Morocco. This has sparked a wave of reactions in the Arab and Somali digital platforms, and Arab and Somali media singled out a wide space in its news and analytical programs for this, and this was accompanied by a number of fallacies regarding the validity of the Buntland regional information and Somaliland located in northeastern Somalia.

The displacement of the Palestinians from Gaza
On this, a source in the Somali Foreign Ministry confirmed to Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed that Somalia will in no way accept the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, and will not be part of the policy of displacement that Washington is planning against the Palestinians. The source pointed out that the federal government is not about to comment on the news of the displacement of the Palestinians, which is reported by the local media And Arabic, indicating that what is currently rumored is just leaks and rumors only promoted by Hebrew media. The source pointed out that the Somali Foreign Ministry will be commented on this news if official statements were issued by the White House regarding the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza to areas in Buntland or Somaliland, which Mogadishu considers part of.
According to the Hebrew Channel 12, Somalland and Bontland, which are a region in Somalia, are not recognized internationally as two independent states, urgently needed recognition by the United States. But the information of the channel is incorrect, because the Puntland region has not sought since its inception in 1998 diplomatic recognition and did not ask to separate from Somalia or something similar Deep between the Somali government and the federal state of Buntland due to bad Understanding in how to organize the presidential elections scheduled for 2026, and these differences emerged in 2024 when the Federal Parliament approved a project to amend the provisions of the Somali constitution and form independent electoral committees, which is what The Puntland government, which later announced its withdrawal of its recognition from the federal government, angered its intention to independence or secession.
As for the Somaliland region, which was actually established in 1992, he seemed to seek international recognition and declared its separation from Somalia, but it did not enjoy international or regional recognition, but in recent months, lawmakers in the US Congress began to pressure the Trump electoral team to make efforts to recognize Somalland as an independent state, but that The efforts are still in the context of speculation and have not yet resulted in little results. In this regard, the Somali Ambassador to Washington, Taher Arab, said in an interview with the media spokesperson for Somali, recently, that the United States will not recognize the Somaliland region, claiming that there is no major reason to recognize this region currently an independent country in the Horn of Africa. He explained that ""Washington will respect international laws, and I do not think it will be part of the policies of dividing Somalia, as this step can lead to serious repercussions on the security and stability of the African Horn region."" Arabs pointed out that the Somalia unit is not negotiable, and that Mogadishu will resort to all diplomatic and options.

In turn, the Deputy Minister of Information in the state of Buntland, Yaqoub Mohamed Abdullah, commented in a statement to local media that ""Puntland is located in the Horn of Africa while Gaza is in the Middle East, and I do not see a logical reason for the displacement of Gaza population to an area they have not chosen."" He explained: ""If there is a desire from some Palestinians to voluntarily move to Puntland, then this is welcome,"" noting that the Palestinians will be part of the development and development that is taking place in the region. On this, the legal researcher from Puntland Abdel Rahman Kilo said, in an interview with ""Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed"", that the news circulating about the transfer of Gazans to Puntland without taking into account the living and economic conditions in which the Puntland areas live are just a daydream.

In the midst of the rapid events taking place in the Middle East, international newspapers analyze political and military developments in the region, especially with regard to the proposals of solutions to the crisis in Gaza.
In this press tour, we review the most prominent ideas that newspapers dealt with about the war in Gaza, and their impact on the Israeli interior, and we also shed light on the analyzes of the Jordanian press after the last meeting between US President Donald Trump and Jordanian King Abdullah II.
We start with an article written by Thomas Friedman in the American newspaper ""The New York Times"" describing Trump's proposal on Gaza as ""the most stupid and dangerous peace initiative of an American president in the Middle East.""
The writer asks: ""What is the most terrifying aspect of this plan: the same proposal by Trump, or the speed of the approval of his aides and members of his government on the idea?""
While Friedman describes the members of the government as ""dolls moved from its head"", it warns that the reality is not only a matter of the Middle East, but a microcosm of what is happening inside America.
End proposed stories
He says that in his first term, Trump was surrounded by people who are bound by his worst actions, while today is surrounded by people ""They live in fear of his anger if they go out of the line.""
The writer believes that Trump's plan may succeed in cinema films, but it will not be achieved on the ground, because the acceptance of Jordan and Egypt or any other Arab country for the Palestinians on its soil will destroy the demographic balance of Jordan, and threaten the stability of Egypt and Israel, as he put it.
The writer, who previously worked as a White House correspondent and worked in the newspaper offices in Beirut and Jerusalem, expects that Muslims in Europe, Asia and the Middle East may go out in widespread demonstrations in refusal to force the Palestinians to leave their lands.
The writer believes that Trump's plan may be the largest gift of the United States to Iran to enable it to return to the political scene in the Middle East. By supporting proposals that may cause the discontent of the pro -American Sunni regimes, Iran will be in a position to enhance its influence in the region at the expense of the traditional allies of the United States, according to Friedman.
The writer notes that he agrees with Trump's view that Hamas is a ""sick and perverted organization"" and that it used the Palestinians as ""human offerings to remove Israel's global legitimacy"", as well as his support for the US President's saying that ""Gaza has turned into hell.""
but Friedman says, ""Any peace process after the events of October 20, 2023 will not be easy, and that the solution to ethnic cleansing is a wrong idea.""

It is worth the end
Friedman notes that one of the largest problems of the current Israeli policy is that Israel, under Netanyahu's leadership, refuses to provide a realistic alternative to Gaza rule, and that Netanyahu seeks to keep the situation as it is, using international political forces in his favor, including the United States.
Friedman also criticizes the American position, as he believes that Trump repeats the same mistakes made by his predecessors, depends on unrealistic and unrealistic plans, and that his proposals on Gaza are ""immature"" attempts aimed at provoking attention without providing effective solutions.
The writer calls, Trump, to take a bold step by inviting all parties concerned to negotiate seriously, ""and the formation of a technocratic government capable of inviting an Arab peace force to supervise Gaza after eliminating Hamas.""
The writer concludes his article that the interests of America and Netanyahu are not compatible, as ""Netanyahu is seeking to stay in power at the expense of anything Another, even if this requires postponing political solutions or continuing wars. ""
Friedman warns of the deterioration of relations between America and countries like Saudi Arabia, as well as strengthening Iran and destabilizing America's allies in the region.
In an article he wrote in the newspaper ""Yediot Aharonot"", Amiki Atii calls for strict measures against Hamas, and to pay a heavy price for any damage to the hostage.
The writer calls on his government to use harsh methods such as ""starvating the enemy and depriving him of water, not motivated by cruelty to innocent civilians, if they exist, but as a necessary measure in order to protect the kidnapped hostages.""
The writer believes that these measures are considered a ""debt that must be paid"" in order to ensure the future and security of future generations.
""The most terrifying of the atrocities committed by Hamas is that Israel has not fundamentally changed the rules of the game after this catastrophe,"" says Atalia.
The writer asks whether the Arab world, including the inhabitants of Gaza, who, despite their losses, are still supporting the attack, realizing that what happened was ""an unprecedented event for the Jewish people in their homeland.""
He adds: ""The Gazans, despite the loss of their homes and their business, are still celebrating what they believe It is a victory, which reflects a clear contradiction in understanding and appreciation for the tragedy between the two parties.
The writer believes that the insufficient response from Israeli and army leaders at the beginning of the crisis, when they failed to take a decisive position, led to the continued situation without change.
He calls for ""imposing a complete siege on enemies"" and depriving them of anything that can help them survive, so that they are gradually pushed towards the Egyptian border and beyond.
And he confirms that ""the inhabitants of Gaza must categorically understand the consequences that will face them if they continue to support violence against Israel.""
The writer notes that there is a double responsibility for Israel: first to liberate the hostages, and secondly, ensuring that the kidnappings of the Jews are not repeated in the future.
He believes that future generations must realize the fatal price that their ancestors paid to avoid trying to commit such actions again. He also criticizes the concept of ""the most moral army in the world"", and says that ""the real way of morals is that Israel be the deadliest power in the world, because this will ensure the protection of children in the future from suffering.""

We conclude our tour with the Jordanian press, whose articles focused on the meeting that brought together Trump with Jordanian King Abdullah II Tuesday at the White House.
The writer Maher Abu Tair in Al -Ghad newspaper addresses the statements issued by the American President regarding the Gaza file, with a focus on the pressures exerted on Jordan and Egypt to receive the residents of Gaza.
Abu Tair highlights the feelings of frustration and resentment raised by these statements in the region, especially in the context in which the American president appears as if he is dealing with countries such as Jordan and Egypt as just parties that can cooperate in displacement or in providing lands for the Palestinians.
The writer also refers to Egypt's categorical rejection of these statements, specifically its rejection of the idea of ??providing lands to the Gazans, which reflects a general Arab discontent towards such statements.
The writer also highlights the Jordanian position, which tried to maintain a humanitarian role in the Palestinian issue, by providing limited assistance such as treating Palestinian children from Gaza.
The writer stresses that ""Jordan seeks to preserve its political, economic and security stability, and refuses to get involved in any scenario that leads to the displacement of the Palestinians, in order to preserve its interests.""
The writer draws attention to the sensitive circumstances issued There are these statements, while emphasizing that ""Jordan will not be part of the displacement plan, pointing to the importance of the unified Arab role in dealing with the Gaza issue.""",UK
"What the Israeli Channel 12 quoted from Adam Bouhler, the envoy of US President Donald Trump for hostage affairs, presents, on Wednesday evening, that he believes that Egypt and the Jordan must provide a substitute after their rejection of Trump's idea to receive the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, asking about the alternatives that Egypt can provide in line With international law and protecting the Palestinian right. Trump's plan to displace the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip was invited during statements to reporters, last Saturday, to transfer part of the residents of the Strip to neighboring countries such as Egypt and Jordan, as a matter of reconstruction, which is a solution in his opinion ""may be temporary or long -term"", to ""purify The sector.
On the other hand, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi considered, during a press conference the day before yesterday, that the deportation or displacement of the Palestinian people is ""an injustice that we cannot participate in,"" stressing that the constants of the Egyptian historical position towards the Palestinian issue cannot be waived in any way. He stated that indulgence or allowing any plan to displace the Palestinians is not possible, pointing out that ""the displacement means instability and represents a threat to the Egyptian and Arab national security."" At the same time, he said, ""Egypt is determined Working with US President Donald Trump to reach the desired peace based on the two -state solution, adding that this is the only way to achieve a fair and permanent settlement of the Palestinian issue.
Options against Trump's plan to displace the Palestinians
According to diplomats and politicians, they spoke to ""Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed"", the commitment to international decisions and the restoration of the Palestinian right is one of the most important alternatives that Egypt can stick to in exchange for Trump's plan to displace the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, by enhancing diplomatic and political efforts towards implementing international decisions related to the issue Palestinian, which affirms the right of the Palestinians to establish an independent state on the 1967 borders, and its capital is East Jerusalem.
Egypt can intensify its efforts at the United Nations and the Security Council to impose the implementation of international decisions
Egypt can intensify its efforts at the United Nations and the Security Council to impose the implementation of international decisions
Egypt can also intensify its efforts at the United Nations and the Security Council to impose the implementation of international decisions, such as Resolution 242 (1967), Resolution 338 (1973) and Resolution 2334 (2016), which condemns the Israeli occupation and demands its withdrawal from the occupied territories After 1967, with the cessation of the residence of the settlements. Egypt can also implement its intention to join the South African lawsuit against the occupying state in the United Nations International Court of Justice, which accused it of violating the genocide -signed agreement in 1948, in light of the war of extermination on the Gaza Strip, since October 7, 2023.
What can Egypt do in the face of Trump's ""cleansing"" plan?
According to these diplomats, Cairo can work to enhance Palestinian national unity, by completing reconciliation efforts between the Palestinian factions, and supporting the construction of strong Palestinian institutions capable of managing an independent Palestinian state. It can also contribute to providing a sustainable dialogue environment that guarantees the unification of Palestinian efforts, which enhances the Palestinian negotiating position in any future talks. The diplomats stressed on the other hand, that the acceleration of the entry of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip comes at the top of the solutions that Egypt can adopt, as the sector suffers from a long -term siege that has deteriorated humanitarian conditions. It can play a pivotal role in the reconstruction of Gaza, by motivating donor countries and supervising re -projects Reconstruction in a way that helps the Palestinians to adhere to their land, and prevents their displacement plans.
One of the alternatives is the pressure to stop Israeli settlement and the violations of the occupation
One of the alternatives is the pressure to stop Israeli settlement and the violations of the occupation
""The pressure to stop Israeli settlement and the violations of the occupation"" is one of the means that can be used instead of Trump's plan to displace the Palestinians from the Strip, as the Israeli settlement activity represents a major obstacle to any fair solution to the Palestinian issue. Egypt can continue its active role in pressure on Israel through diplomatic channels and international bodies to stop settlement expansion, which violates international laws, and undermines any opportunities to establish a Palestinian state that is connected geographically and viable. In the opinion of diplomats, Egypt can also offer new visions to enhance the Arab Peace Initiative, which is based on the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied territories in exchange for Arab normalization with it. The initiative can also be updated to include executive mechanisms that force Israel to adhere to the principles of a fair and comprehensive solution. Also in front of Egypt, the option to work to strengthen international alliances supporting the Palestinian cause, through cooperation with The European Union, China and Russia, and pushing these forces to pressure Israel to implement international decisions, and also work to restore the Palestinian issue to the forefront of international attention through international summits and conferences.
An emergency meeting of the Egyptian civil movement to face the Trump plan
Rejection is not enough
While Egypt completely rejects the idea of ??resettlement or absorbing the Palestinians instead of their legitimate right to establish their independent state, this rejection is not sufficient, according to observers, as there are legal and national duties that guarantee the restoration of the Palestinian right and the establishment of their independent state. Among these duties is the acceleration of the reconstruction of Gaza and the cessation of settlement, which is the realistic solutions that Egypt can adopt to confront any attempts to obscure or liquidate the Palestinian issue, and it is one of the most important risks that may result from Trump's plan to displace the Palestinians from Gaza. In the context, Dr. Ayman Salama, a member of the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs, and a professor of international law, said in a statement to ""Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed"" that ""Sisi's historical statement rejecting the displacement and deportation of the Palestinians from their land reflects Egypt's insistence on preserving the Arab constants."" Salama explained that this statement ""carries a strong message to The international community that any attempt to liquidate the Palestinian issue will face legal and diplomatic resistance. ""

""
Al -Houthi explained that it is not permissible for the Arabs to accept the American plan, considering that their acceptance of it means that they are ""participating in a basic role in the terrible crime with the American, and the American seeks to catch Arab regimes in a great scandal and crime and in a very heavy matter against their religion, nation, and the interest of their countries and their peoples."" Al -Houthi stressed that ""there should not be any Approval of the American plan and that the position on it be a fixed and steadfast position, otherwise it is a major betrayal that has serious repercussions.

"Five Arab foreign ministers, in addition to a senior Palestinian official, sent a ""common message"" to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in which they renewed their rejection of plans to displace the Palestinians from Gaza proposed by President Donald Trump at the end of January.
This message was sent on Monday, which is signed by the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Qatar, Egypt and Jordan, as well as the advisor of the Palestinian President Hussein Al -Sheikh.
Axius was the first to report the news, noting that the ministers met in Cairo at the beginning of the week.
On January 25, Trump laid for the first time the reception of Jordan and Egypt from the Gaza Strip. When asked if he was suggested as a long -term or short -term solution, the American president said: ""None of them.""
His statements have made these ancient Palestinian concerns about their displacement from their homes forever, and criticized them as a proposal for ethnic cleansing. Jordan, Egypt and other Arab countries opposed the proposal.
The letter said: ""The reconstruction of Gaza must take place through direct interaction with the people of Gaza and their participation. The Palestinians will live in their land and help rebuild it.""
The Arab foreign ministers added: ""They should not be removed from their land during the reconstruction, as they should actively participate in the process with the support of the international community.""
The ministers had said Saturday in a joint statement during a meeting in Cairo that they refused to ""displace"" the Palestinians from their land or ""encourage their transfer"", expressing their hope to work with the Donald Trump administration ""in order to implement the two -state solution.""
For reference, the statements of the Ministry of Health in Gaza indicated that the Israeli military attack on the Strip killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, and sparked accusations of genocide and war crimes denied by Tel Aviv.

"The arrest of the security services of the Palestinian Authority, the correspondent of Al -Jazeera channel, Muhammad al -Atrash, cannot be seen and referred to the Hebron Court, away from the political context in which this authority operates. It ranges between sharing jobs with the Israeli occupation, and circumventing it in the hope of avoiding harm or to gain some time in the face of an Israeli -right government that wants to expand in the West Bank, but sometimes raises the issue of forcibly displacing the inhabitants of the West Bank.
There are many forms and forms of matching the Palestinian Authority of the Benjamin Netanyahu government through the arrest of activists and resistance in various cities of the West Bank and its towns, and the closure of roads leading to Palestinian camps resisting, and contributing to the mug of resistance and degradation, and describing what you do as a clumsy work, as part of the repercussions of the Palestinian division that It has been deepened since 2005, and in light of the competition to represent the Palestinian people in the occupied land A real, not formal representation.
Then the occupation service came to obscure what it committed against the Palestinians of the West Bank, which was the trend that led in early January to the Palestinian Authority’s decision to stop the broadcast of Al -Jazeera and freeze all its activities. And accusing her of ""inciting rebellion"".
The authority did not differ from the media, regarding Israel that it had decided on September 22nd from the closure of the two newspapers (Arabic and English) news in Ramallah after storming and confiscating their contents and preventing their employees from work, after a broad incitement campaign, while it was The channel’s office in Jerusalem was closed after it assassinated its correspondents in the Gaza Strip.
All of this raises a fundamental question about the motives and goals that the Palestinian Authority aims to from behind its current position, which receives sharp criticism and objection from the various resistance forces, and from political activists who do not like the leadership of Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), and from independent Palestinian intellectuals or anti -occupation and supporters For the resistance project.
And taking into account the position of the various parties, and the nature of the existing conditions, these causes, motives and goals can be explained in the following points:
1- Inclusion, but rather, the Palestinian Authority is gradually involved in a pattern of ""sharing of jobs"" with the Israeli occupation, feeding economic benefits through networks of interests in the ranks of the Palestinians, based on the trade of goods and services and receiving subsidies The foreign authority that enables this authority to pay the salaries of its employees and its security men.
This situation also feeds political perceptions that negotiate, despite its stumbling and loss of its feasibility over time, can lead to some gains, dependent on what the 1993 Oslo agreement arranged that Israel refused to implement its last stage on sovereignty and water and the situation of Jerusalem, but rather worked to empty what The Palestinians received it according to this agreement through continuous pressure, constant restrictions, permanent disguise, and repeated assault on the West Bank residents, And continuing to settle, and deduct money successively from the Palestinian Authority’s allocations, or mortgaged it on harsh conditions, as long as it is deducted in succession of the ability, prestige, function and benefit of this authority.
2- The Palestinian Authority may estimate the permanent and chronic imbalance in the balance of power between the Palestinians and the Israeli army, in a way that justifies the acceptance of the fait accompli, and patience for its disbelief, and gives this cover that it responds to the demand of a sector of Palestinians in the West Bank who fear that they will enter into an open confrontation with Israel It may lead to the deepening of the harm caused by them to reach the limit of ""genocide"", similar to what happened in the sector Gaza.
3- The Palestinian Authority views the resistance movement in the West Bank with the eye of suspicion, and it is transmitted, mostly generally, to the link of Hamas and Jihad or estimated, at least, the extent of its affected by the direction that the two movements took, and the Palestinian resistance factions, which is biased to the armed struggle As the effective way to obtain digested and deferred Palestinian rights.
Such a link or even influence means simply withdrawing the rug from under the feet of the Palestinian Authority, and then this authority in Israel finds a support for it, in order to preserve its positions and benefits, even though Tel Aviv wants in fact to end the existence of this authority from the ground.
4- The Palestinian Authority considers that it does not have the ability to manage its back for obligations that restrict it as the party that has made it with agreements with Israel with international sponsorship and official regional blessing, and therefore it is responsible for the international community for representing and controlling the Palestinians, if it wants Israel and the outside world, to deal With her, and leaves her standing even in light of her weakness and inability to protect the Palestinian people.
5- The Palestinian Authority lacks any ambition that qualifies it to dispute Israel or Her homes, especially in light of her chronic aging, and thus always work to avoid everything that raises the anger of Tel Aviv, and what would contribute to achieving a long -term desire to stable in the Israeli -political religious faith, makes her look at the West Bank with a greater eye than her view of Gaza Strip.
But this vision adopted by the Palestinian Authority appears to be largely deficient. Its security is harmful to the people of the West Bank, including within Ramallah (the headquarters of the Palestinian Authority), of killing, arrests, demolitions and domination Agricultural lands or bite them to calculate settlements on their ruins.
What makes matters worse is that the recent security actions of the Palestinian Authority, which is distributed to the arrest of activists, resistance and media, comes at a time when Israel is preparing with a full military division to invade Jenin and its camp.
What made the Palestinian Authority seem more identical with the intentions of the occupation and its goals, those continuous clashes that took place for weeks between the forces The security of this authority and gunmen in a fetus, most of whom belong to the jihad and Hamas movements, and at the same time working to conceal the truth and its confusion, ""at a time when the Palestinian people need a audible voice that delivers their suffering to the world,"" according to the statement issued by the Islamic Jihad movement.
Netanyahu, who was forced to a truce in Gaza, has not yet waived the importance of the war for him personally to escape punishment awaiting him, and its importance also to his right -wing alliance, which some of his symbols did not want to stop in the Gaza Strip, and thus will work to expand the scope of fighting in the West Bank, not in Jenin alone, but in other regions, and its time may be aware of the mute of the Palestinians, who arrives in the world through the media, and whoever participated in a chase The opponents of the West Bank, that he had made a serious mistake against the Palestinian people and their cause.

"The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nahfi Jabali, rejected the categorical council for any arrangements or attempts to change the geographical and political reality of the Palestinian issue, stressing the importance of preserving the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, and the exchange of hostages and prisoners between the two sides (Israeli and Palestinian), as this is a first step in the path of peace achievement .
Jabali said in a speech at the parliament session, Monday, that the theses circulating about the displacement of the Palestinians completely ignore the established fact that the Palestinian issue is not just a geographical conflict, but rather the issue of a people fighting for their legitimate historical rights, adding that the Palestinian issue does not only represent the battle of the struggle of a people from He postponed his legitimate rights, but rather embodies a test of the values ??of justice, peace and stability.
Jabali added that ""Egypt's standing beside Palestine is not just a political commitment, but rather a bias to the right and the right side of history, especially with the suffering of the Palestinian people, sticking to the broken violations, including the permissibility of the blood of children, women and the elderly in full view of the world."" He continued, ""The ceasefire agreement came in a milestone in which the Palestinians were bitter bitterness And starvation and repression for more than 15 months, in light of a suspicious international inability to confront a serious threat to international peace and security, ""stressing that Egypt focuses its efforts on stabilizing the agreement, ensuring the implementation of its provisions in its three time stages, and preventing any new escalation, while continuing to provide human support and vital assistance The people of Gaza need.
Egypt facing Trump's pressure and challenging national security constants
Jabali continued that ""the great danger that the theses circulated about the displacement of the Palestinians from their land cannot be overlooked, after they presented thousands of martyrs and sacrificed the precious and precious, adding that the Palestinian people are not a group of people looking for shelter, but a people with an ancient history, and a sacred land, And an authentic right that does not fall into statute of limitations. ""
He added that such theses are trying to circumvent the rights of the Palestinian people, and are not limited to their threat alone, but rather a grave danger to regional security and stability, because of the obstruction of the current truce sustainability efforts, and its arrival to a permanent ceasefire, in addition to the displacement of the Palestinians meaning it means The conflict was transferred to other lands, with the catastrophic repercussions of this region.
Jabali concluded by saying that The only solution to achieving permanent peace is the implementation of a two -state solution, in a manner that guarantees the Palestinian people to establish an independent state on the 1967 borders, and its capital is East Jerusalem, and also guarantees the security and stability of the entire region, which requires the launch of a serious and comprehensive political process that enables the Palestinian Authority to perform its duties in Gaza and the West Bank Western, support for reconstruction and human aid flow projects.
In a related context, the ""Egyptian Social Democratic"" party made an appeal to the party and popular forces, and the professional unions, regarding joining a popular delegation heading to the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian -Palestinian border next Friday, in order to express Egypt's full solidarity with the brotherly Palestinian people, and he refused Attempts to forced displacement for them from the Gaza Strip, and liquidate their just cause.
The party said, on its official Facebook page, that the visit of the Rafah crossing aims to protest against the plans of displacement of the Palestinians, and the flagrant violation of international law and a direct threat to the stability of the region, stressing its support the official position expressed by the Egyptian Foreign Ministry statement, on Sunday, for support The legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, foremost of which is the establishment of their state Independent on its lands, and its capital is East Jerusalem.
For its part, Egyptian professional unions held a consultative meeting today to agree on a unified position that expresses the masses of Egyptian professionals towards the plans of the American administration aimed at displacing the Palestinian people from their land, provided that a press conference will be held tomorrow, Tuesday, to announce a unified position for them, and the details of their upcoming moves.
The meeting, which was held at the headquarters of the Journalists Syndicate in the center of the capital, Cairo, discussed the organization of solidarity activities with the steadfast Palestinian people, who refused to leave its land, and with the Egyptian regime, which renewed its position rejecting ""the violation of the unusable Palestinian rights, whether through settlement, or the annexation of the land, Or evacuated by its owners by displacement, or encouraging the transfer or uprooting of the Palestinians from their land temporarily or long -term.
During the consultations that preceded the meeting, the captains and representatives of the doctors, engineers, lawyers, representative professions and journalists discussed communication with a greater number of unions and institutions and organizations of Egyptian society, in order to agree on a unified message to support the Palestinian issue.
US President Donald Trump has announced his intention to contact his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Al -Fattah Al -Sisi to discuss the possibility of transferring Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Egypt. Since the beginning of the Israeli aggression on Gaza on October 7, 2023, Egypt has adhered to the rejection of all displacement projects aimed at transporting the Palestinians to the Sinai, and Cairo seemed more coordinated with Jordan, which faces similar plans aimed at displacing the West Bank residents to Jordan to facilitate the process of annexing it to Israel.",UK
"The ceasefire agreement was born with a complex and difficult caesarean section after more than fifteen months of Israeli rejection, stubbornness, evasion, maneuvering and lying, in order to achieve the goals of aggression over time; By eliminating Hamas militarily and authoritatively, and restoring the prisoners by military force.
These are the goals that have evolved with the continued aggression against Gaza to become the displacement of Palestinians from the northern Gaza Strip, according to what was known as the plan of the generals, the occupation of the Gaza Strip, and the start of permanent occupying settlement projects.
Benjamin Netanyahu, the occupation ministers, worked all the time to sustain the aggression on Gaza, to achieve absolute victory, according to his claim, and used his tactical intelligence to manage the scene by escaping from any benefits that lead to stopping the aggression; The May 2024 agreement rejected the ceasefire, and rejected the recommendation of the International Court of Justice in May 2024, which called for an immediate ceasefire of military operations in the city of Rafah and the opening of the Rafah crossing; To ensure that aid is entered into the Gaza Strip, he refused to adhere to the UN Security Council Resolution 2735 issued in June 2024 and calling for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of the occupation army from the Gaza Strip, and the July 2024 agreement refused to a ceasefire that Hamas accepted him and Netanyahu rejected him.
What made this major shift in the scene, and prompted Netanyahu to accept?
Benjamin Netanyahu signed, and since the first days after the battle of the Flood of Al -Aqsa, in a fatal mistake to make emotional decisions and a head of Ham, without a real political vision of the goals of the war or the future of the Gaza Strip, thinking that he is able to achieve the absolute victory in the besieged sector for more than 17 years, so that became that The goals are restricted to him and his extremist government in front of the Israeli public, who are enthusiastic and anger to take revenge on the Gaza Strip with all Its components, and without a distinction between humans, stone and trees, with absolute and open support from the administration of President Biden, which opened to Israel its warehouses of deadly weapons.
This error in decision -making, in addition to that it is emotional, was taken in light of the shallow intelligence information about the power of the Al -Qassam and Resistance Brigades, and was taken in light of the underestimation of the solid Palestinian people.
The performance of the Palestinian resistance led by the Izzdin Al -Qassam Brigades, and its amazing ability to plan and implement in the battlefield, and the occupation is incurred by severe economic losses estimated by the Ministry of Finance of the occupation first with 34 billion dollars, and a deficit in the budget of the year 2024 reached about 38 billionaires, losses in the occupation soldiers and its officers (about 891 soldiers and officers were killed, about 13,500, 43% of them suffer from mental illnesses, according to the occupation sources), and the destruction and damage of about 2000 heavy and tank mechanisms.
The legendary steadfastness of the popular incubator and its protection of the resistance despite the genocide and the crimes of ethnic cleansing that were subjected to (47 thousand martyrs, 110 thousand Greg, and 11 thousand missing), and the destruction of about 70-80% of housing and service sectors.
All of this failed the plans of forced displacement and thwarted the political and military goals of the occupation, and made all Israeli and American intelligence estimates confirm the impossibility of defeating the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, or the defeat of Hamas, which was described as an idea that is impossible to defeat militarily.
After the Battle of the Flood of Al -Aqsa, the Israeli public rushed over a stinging manner towards supporting the aggression on the Gaza Strip, without moral or political considerations that recognize the existence of the Palestinian people or their national rights, which constituted a safety network for Netanyahu's extremist government in its brutal aggression against the Gaza Strip and its army committed war crimes and genocide.
This trend remains based on the extent that the size of economic and human losses increased and destabilized Security and stability within the entity, and until the occupation government concluded an agreement to a ceasefire with the Lebanese Hezbollah, at a time when it failed to resolve the battle in the Gaza Strip even after the martyrdom of Yahya Al -Sinwar in the battlefield, which is referred to responsible for the battle of the Al -Aqsa Flood.
This accumulation and the lack of a horizon for the military approach to eliminating Hamas or the release of the prisoners by force, prompted the Israeli public to turn towards stopping the war and release the prisoners in agreement with Hamas, as the percentage of supporters exceeded the 80%, which put the government of the extreme right in front of internal pressure Continuous and growing.
Netanyahu and the extremist right reverted to President Trump's victory in the presidential elections, based on their experience with him in his previous presidential session in which he transferred the American embassy to Jerusalem, and recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan, and adopted the American century deal that was designed according to Benjamin Netanyahu's perception at the time and which was practically means A Palestinian self -rule under Israeli sovereignty.
But the wind came to what Netanyahu and the Zionist right did not desire, as President Trump placed a timetable not exceeding 20 January/ January of this year, the day of his main inauguration to the United States, and sent his envoy to the Middle East Steve Whittvo, who met Netanyahu and, according to many Israeli and American sources, firm and rude with Netanyahu and asked him to agree to the ceasefire, otherwise his refusal will have consequences for Israel , Which was crammed with Netanyahu in the corner and forced him to respond to response and acceptance With an agreement similar to the May 2024 agreement, which he previously rejected, it came down at the conditions of the resistance and Hamas.
Interpretation of President Trump's position is due to the conviction that Israel failed to achieve its goals, and will not be able to eliminate Hamas militarily or authoritarianly after it took its full opportunity within 15 months.
This is in addition to Trump, perhaps in the continuation of the Israeli war on the Gaza Strip, disturbing to address many files in the Middle East, such as the Iranian nuclear file, and normalization with Saudi Arabia, which rejects rapprochement with Israel in light of the continued aggression against Gaza, not to mention Washington's desire to get rid of attrition and headache Which was caused by Israel's failure to eliminate Hamas or break the will of the Palestinian people, at a time when the Ain Trump is located on China and the war in Ukraine, control over Greenland and Panama, and annexed Canada if he could.
With a quick comparison, the Israeli occupation led by Netanyahu and the extreme right -wing failed to achieve their goals; They did not succeed in displacing the Palestinians or occupying the Strip despite the brutal shelling, destruction and systematic killing, and they did not succeed in eliminating Hamas militarily and Silent, and they could not recover the prisoners with military force, as we followed how Hamas managed to hand over the three prisoners in Gaza City, in a way that amazed the observers, where Control and control amid large crowds of joyful masses, and a large and remarkable military appearance of the Al -Qassam Brigades with a uniform And a new weapon and vehicles amid massive destruction.
On the other hand, the Hamas movement, since the first day of the ceasefire, was able to deploy the police, which killed the occupation from its employees more than 700 people during the aggression, and the security forces of the Ministry of Interior, the civil defense and municipal teams in cities deployed to follow up on people's affairs and open the main closed roads, with the start of entry Aid to distribute it to all regions.
This indicates that the Hamas movement is still in the presence of a civil and military authoritarian, and enjoys With widespread support for the Palestinian audience, which formed and is still a popular incubator, it provided Hamas to support, protection and legitimacy.
In the same context, the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip showed, despite the pain, pain and loss, an exceptional state of resilience and demand for life, to give a message to the occupier and the world that the Palestinian has not and will not be broken, and that as he succeeded in the battle, he will succeed in restoring life to the Gaza Strip despite The catastrophe made by the Israeli occupation, with the support of the administration of President Biden.
If the battles are measured by their results and goals, it can be said; Israel has failed miserably, the Hamas movement and the Palestinian people succeeded in the battle of will and awareness on the path of liberation and return.
One of the most important repercussions made by the Battle of Toufan Al -Aqsa, after the legendary steadfastness of the Palestinian people:
All of this will be a sign of weakness in the occupied body of Israel internally and externally, and the beginning of the end of the future of Benjamin Netanyahu, who will face difficult questions about responsibility for this strategic failure.
On the other hand, faith will grow regionally and internationally with the need to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self -determination, and to establish their independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, as a condition For regional and international stability.

"
We start our tour from the British Guardian newspaper, and an article entitled ""Goodbye to the lost children of Gaza ... We loved you and reminds you. You do not deserve what happened to you,"" written by Nisreen Malik.
The writer begins by talking about the return of the Gaza Strip to their homes, most of which have turned into ruins, and to their dead, which are still lying under the rubble.
The writer believes that ""only we will start getting a more complete picture of the real losses of this war, and now only any kind of sadness or mourning can start, which is the process from which the Palestinians have been deprived physically and emotionally for the past fifteen months.""
And she wrote: ""Once the final outcome becomes clear, it is likely that a huge number of children were killed.""
""Indeed, indicators reveal that the children were the ones who formed the majority of the victims. The United Nations analysis of deaths, which was verified during a five -month period, confirmed that 44 percent of the dead were children. In most cases, these children were ranging The age of five to nine years, and 80 percent of them were killed in their homes. ""
End proposed stories
The writer believes that these statistics It is not just numbers, but a tragedies that Palestinian children lived. It considers that the ceasefire is now turning attention from death, and conveying it to analyzing what can be and what should happen after that regarding the mysterious future of Gaza.
""But this includes the risk of reducing what happened. What happened is that thousands of innocent people died, including thousands of children.""

It is worth the end
The writer believes that the terrifying thing is not only that they died, but the way they died.
""Many people died in their homes, on the shaken ground, amid the noise of bombs, then they were crushed or strangled, to be recovered and they were covered with dust, or they were assembled in plastic bags. Others died in the utmost pain, as anesthesia and medical supplies resulted in surrender Some of the injury without any rest.
The writer refers to ""moments of panic and pain that preceded the death of these children, which we will not know about anything, because those who lived them have not been alive from them now to tell those stories.""
She adds: ""But in The state of few, such as the five -year -old Hind Rajab, is a painful glimpse of the type of terror they suffered. She was killed among her dead relatives, alone after she begged the emergency services over the phone to save her. The line was cut off after the shooting sounds. ""
The writer notes that ""what we knew only represents the stories of a small number of these children, some of whom were found analyzed in the intensive care rooms, and others freezed to death, and others wrote their parents their names in black ink on their bodies so that they can be identified.""
""Every death of these deaths is a unique tragedy.""
The writer indicates that there are nearly forty thousand orphans in Gaza, thousands of amputee, hundreds of thousands of displaced people whose schools were destroyed, as well as the complete psychological destruction of all children who lived in the war.
She wrote: “Twenty thousand children are still missing, and they are still under the rubble or buried in mass graves. With the erasing of most of the infrastructure in Gaza and the normal life was stopped due to the war, their deaths accumulated and moved to a state of statistical ambiguity. Prayers, not moments of silence, and no Celebrate their lives, spirit, and personalities. ""
She concluded: ""But all the concerted efforts, which were made to reduce the value of the life of those who died, do not make this a reality. Before we rush to the next stage of the tragedy of Gaza, we must stop before them, and in front of ourselves, whatever our political orientations, let's think The small life that I have been removed from them. To you.

We move to the Israeli Jerusalem Post, and an article entitled ""The long enthusiasm will require a greater investment in mental health resources,"" written by Israeli doctor Jonathan Lieberman.
The writer begins his article by talking about the shots that showed the moments of Hamas's release of the three Israeli hostages about a week ago, in the first step of carrying out the ceasefire, which caused the ""emotional stability collapse"", as he described it.
Lieberman expresses the confusion of his feelings, which mixed with each other, as if ""it was placed in a juice mixer that was operated with its full strength.""
He writes: ""There was joy in the reunion of Rumi, Emily and Doron with their families. There was almost a strong and painful desire that Their hostile colleagues join them to reunite them to their families. ""
At the same time, he referred to his feelings of ""disgusting from the lust of blood that the media has shown by their kidnappers,"" and the fear of the consequences of the release of many ""hardline terrorists"", referring to Palestinian prisoners, as well as ""hope for the nightmare approaching its end.""
He wrote: ""The initial focus will, of course, focus on the physical health of the hostages released, but we should not ignore or reduce the impact of the horrors of the seventh of October, which formed a new era, and the subsequent effects on mental health, not only for the hostages And also to the wounded, the beacher, the displaced, and every citizen in the country.
Then the writer touches on what he called ""Hitler's long shadow"", which the Jews suffered after the second war, and ""is the ongoing and deep shock that the second to the third generation felt, from the victims of the Holocaust or the survivors of it"", then linking this to the events of the seventh of October.
He wrote: ""The collective shock, which we have passed as a nation since the seventh of October and we are still suffering from it, will be parallel to this image, and we must prepare for the long shadow of Hamas.""
The writer believes that there A severe shortage of psychologists and psychologists, and other mental health professionals in Israel, and this may be due to a number of factors, including lack of financing, bad working conditions, and high demand for services.
He wrote: ""Long -term solutions to this crisis must include a greater investment by the state in the infrastructure of mental health, and the resources needed to address the long -term effects of war.""
The writer believes that there is an urgent need to train more therapists, especially those who are proficient in shock -related advice.
He wrote: ""In the short term, we all need to intensify efforts and turn into amateur psychologists.""
The writer concludes his article by providing some advice, which helps Israelis learn how to discover the signs of their post -trauma disorder and others, and to guide those who suffer from them to the appropriate services.

Finally, we read an article in the London -based Al -Sharq Al -Awsat newspaper entitled ""Beirut ... a visitor named Al -Amal"", written by Ghassan Charbel.
The writer believes that ""Lebanon has a balance in its Arab world, the years of the long decline did not succeed in wasting it.""
The writer points to a call he received Recently, an Arab politician is his friend, in which he expressed his pleasure in electing Lebanon as its president after two years of vacancy.
Charbel quoted that politician: ""I call you to express my joy with what I hear. I understood that Lebanon chose for the presidency of the Republic a honest man, who could trust his fate based on his keenness to adhere to sovereignty and unity and respect for the constitution and institutions, which is General Joseph Aoun. He rejoiced that he chose to form the government A man from outside the club, collects efficiency, integrity and respected international reputation, is Nawaf Peace.
The writer also quoted that politician his wishes that the Lebanese would not commit the sin of wasting the opportunity, stressing the existence of an actual Arab desire to help Lebanon to restore the conditions of normal life in the shadow of a state and institutions with the revival of its economy, considering that the visit of the Saudi Foreign Minister to Lebanon is a translation of a Saudi decision in this direction.
""The world is ready to help Lebanon. It remains for the Lebanese to decide to help their country and leave the wars of the shares, the wrong bets, and attempts to use abroad to the heart of the scales inside. I hope with all my heart that this opportunity will not be lost.""
The writer recalls words he heard during decades The past, about what Beirut means a symbol of many Arabs ""with its vitality, diversity, will to progress in it and its windows open to the near environment and the world"" and its writers, intellectuals and freedom of the press in it.
He referred to the admiration of the leaders and politicians of the Arabs who are departing and contemporary at that time, such as Hazem Jawad, who led the Iraqi ""Baath"" party to power in 1963, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, Vice President of the United Arab Emirates and Ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and others.
The writer says that the words of his Arab political friend came at a time, in which the Israeli army shoots on the Lebanese who are trying to return to their southern villages, even if to live near the rubble of their homes.
He wrote: ""It is clear that the government of Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to lure Lebanon to deepen its tragedy.""
He continued: ""The important thing is that the Lebanese are handed over, despite their pain, that they have no salvation except betting on the state alone, to retrieve the entire soil, sovereignty and natural living, in a state that is obsessed with stability and prosperity.""",UK

"Official preparations are accelerating, and the organization of massive demonstrations is accelerated in protest against the controversial proposal of US President Donald Trump on the displacement of Palestinians to Egypt, which is seen as a threat to liquidate the issue and expel the Palestinians from their lands. According to political sources, those close to the regime and youth groups began to coordinate youth and parties related to the strongest public intelligence services, in addition to the leaders of the three parties affiliated with the various security services, which are the ""Future of the Nation"" parties, ""the protectors of the homeland"", and the ""National Front"" ( Under the foundation), in preparing for marches that are likely to start from next Friday in various parts of the country, in protest of what is known In the media, the ""Deal of the Century"", which Trump announced his intention to see the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi.
The demonstrations aim, according to sources that spoke to Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed, to express the Egyptian people's rejection of the proposal to displace the Palestinians, which many consider a step towards liquidating the rights of the Palestinians, while observers saw that such demonstrations aim to deliver an indirect rejection message to the American side, explaining the occurrence of the Egyptian regime below Popular pressures that support the situation The official, the American plan.
The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement yesterday, in which it rejected the plan to displace the Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt, which Trump announced his adoption and his intention to watch Sisi on Sunday, which did not happen until today, despite his contact with Bahraini King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa after his contact The Jordanian monarch, King Abdullah bin Al -Hussein, was supposed to be followed by a call to Sisi. The crowds are expected to gather in several symbolic areas in Egypt, most notably Tahrir Square in Cairo, in addition to other fields in the capitals of the governorates, and the demonstrations will carry slogans and banners condemning attempts to displace the Palestinians and support their just cause.
In conjunction with these preparations, recent calls emphasize the importance of sending a strong message to the international community, according to which the Egyptian people, with all its spectrum, stands one row in supporting the rights of the Palestinians and rejects any settlement that affects these rights. The sources indicate that the participants in the demonstrations intend to launch massive convoys from various governorates to show a large crowd, but it is governed and organized, so that these demonstrations are an opportunity to enhance Arab and international solidarity with the Palestinian people.
These preparations come At a sensitive time, in light of the ongoing political developments, which threaten the future of the Palestinian issue. Observers believe that the planned demonstrations, which were previously organized months ago, express the position of the regime that prevents, in an exciting paradox, to express the position of the general Egyptian people towards the question of Palestine, through a tight security grip.

A Palestinian condemnation of Trump's invitation to deport the people of Gaza: Our people reject the crimes of displacement

Observers are wondering whether the authorities will take an important step by releasing the youth who went out on the same day of the previous demonstrations during unaccounted demonstrations, stressing that the step of their release today at this time aims to ensure the integrity of the Egyptian position in supporting the rights of the Palestinians.",UK

"The displacement of the Palestinians from their lands is an Israeli dream that the Hebrew state has not stopped thinking about it since the Nakba of 1948, and from time to time the idea is renewed, whether from within, or from the Allied America, where the latest attempts was the suggestion of President Donald Trump to transfer residents in Gaza to Egypt and Jordan, the two Arab countries They are adjacent to the borders of the occupied Palestinian territories.

According to the monitoring of the ""Middle East"", the calls varied between statements and official plans, especially an American -Israel 2023.

Trump's proposal, which was presented, on Saturday, was popular and media rejection in Egypt, was considered by the Palestinian historian, Abdelkader Yassin, ""not the first and the last will not be in the plans of displacement of the Palestinians"", expecting that ""the informal rejection of these projects, whether from the Palestinian resistance movements, will increase , Or from the Arab peoples. ”

Yassin told Al -Sharq Al -Awsat that the projects of resettlement of the Palestinians in the Arab countries have known a frequent historical presence, especially starting in 1953, with what was known at the time as the “Sinai Plan”, as well as the “Al -Jazeera Project”. Northern Syria, to settle the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq, and the ""Johnson Project"" to resettle the Palestinians in the eastern and western countryside around the Jordan River.

And he confirms that ""Washington and its ally Israel are usually standing historically behind those projects that have received an official Arab rejection, and at the popular level as well, especially the Palestinian.""

The Palestinians knew ""forced displacement"" of their homeland in 1948, with the announcement of the establishment of the State of Israel, and the following year the United Nations established the Palestinian Refugee Relief Agency (UNRWA) in order to respond to the needs of nearly three quarters of a million Palestinians.

The year 1953 witnessed the launch of the ""Sinai Plan"", which was supported by Washington, and includes ""displacement of Palestinians"" for this Egyptian spot, according to the historian Abdel Qader Yassin, and July (July) came 1967 to continue the production machine for attempts to displacement, through the launch of the Israeli politician and military, Egal Alon, The Council of Ministers of his country must have a plan to impose a regional settlement aimed at deporting Palestinians to Jordan and Egypt, and did not see the light.

In 1970, the commander of the southern region of the Israeli army, Ariel Sharon, who later became prime minister, adopted a discharged plan The Gaza Strip is one of its residents, and hundreds of them were transferred to Sinai and the city of Al -Arish, which were under the Israeli occupation at the time, and did not succeed in continuing.

The plans continued with the year 2000, with the Israeli military commander, Guyra Island, continued a project that includes Cairo's concessions in Sinai in favor of a proposed Palestinian state, in exchange for privileges to Egypt, and he was not successful ... and that project was repeated after 4 years by the former president The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Joshua Bin Arrei, did not come out of the discussion of the implementation as well.

In the first state of Trump (2017 - 2020), the media started in 2018, about an American plan to displace the Palestinians under what was called the ""Deal of the Century"", and in March 2019, the King of Jordan, Abdullah II, announced the rejection of the idea of ??""the alternative homeland And Emiratisation, stressing that Palestine and Jerusalem are a red line, amid repeated Egyptian official and media positions on the rejection of the displacement plans.

Trump officially revealed the deal in his first term in 2020, under the title ""Peace on the Road of Prosperity"", and met an explicit Arab rejection, and was not achieved with the loss of the US President at the time the presidential elections in front of his rival Joe Biden.

The ""Gaza War"" was a station New to an Israeli return to the ""displacement plan"", where a paper published by the Israeli ""Mjafaf"" institute revealed, on October 17, 2023, calling for removing the Palestinians to Egypt, and on the 14th of the following month, the extremist finance minister, Battalil Smotrich, called for ""voluntary migration and the assimilation of Arabs Gaza in the countries of the world. ”

At the beginning of 2024, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair denied a report of the Israeli channel ""12"" on talks it said was then in Israel on ""displacement of the Palestinians"" from the Gaza Strip to Arab countries. In late November, Smotrich renewed the call to encourage Gaza residents to emigrate within two years.

On Saturday, Trump launched an initiative for both Egypt and Jordan to receive more Palestinian refugees from Gaza, amid a broad Palestinian rejection, especially from Hamas, while it received wide support from the Israeli right, headed by the resigned Israeli National Security Minister Etamar bin Ghafir, And finance, with a smokeric.

About the Middle East",PS
"A number of Jordanian deputies suggested, last Wednesday, the issuance of a draft law that prevents the displacement of Palestinians to Jordan, after the statements of US President Donald Trump about extending his country's control over the Gaza Strip, and resettling the Palestinians in other places, including Jordan and Egypt.
Representative Khamis Attia, head of the Erda and Islamic Bloc, announced the adoption of a proposal to issue a bill aimed at preventing the displacement of Palestinians to the Kingdom. So far, the proposal has adopted about 50 deputies of various parliamentary blocs, spectrums and independent deputies. It is expected that the number of deputies signed on the proposal is expected, especially since the proposal was submitted on a day there was no meeting of the Jordanian House of Representatives, whose members are 138.
According to the parliamentary proposal, the reasons for the draft law are aimed at not prejudice to national unity and affirming the sovereignty of Jordan, in line with the provisions of the constitution with all its provisions, and the full official and popular rejection of the Jordanian to displace the Palestinians to Jordan as an alternative homeland, as Jordan for Jordanians and Palestine for the Palestinians, and the Palestinian people is the one who decides its fate, adding To the absolute refusal to liquidate the Palestinian issue, and the implementation of Jordan each International obligations, covenants and norms that have been forbidden and prevented forced displacement.
The pillars of a draft law prohibiting the displacement of the Palestinians
The proposal of a draft law prohibits the displacement of Palestinians on international humanitarian law, including the Geneva Conventions of 1949, which prohibits forced deportation, and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (1998), which classifies forced displacement a crime against humanity, war crime, and United Nations decisions, It condemns forced displacement and calls for the protection of the rights of refugees and the displaced, and the international covenant on civil and political rights (1966), which, in its 12th article, prohibits the forced deportation of people or prevented them from returning to their homelands.
Khamis Attia: The law proposal is a political message from the House of Representatives that Jordan refuses to displace
Khamis Attia: The law proposal is a political message from the House of Representatives that Jordan refuses to displace
Attia told Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed that “what we have done in the Erda and the Islamic Bloc to submit a law proposal to prevent the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza to Jordan to a political message from the House of Representatives that Jordan refuses to displacement, and stands with the Palestinian people, by stabilizing his steadfastness at home until the departure Occupation The Zionist about Palestine, all of Palestine. King Abdullah II succeeded in refusing to displace the Palestinians, ""stressing that Trump's the occupation of Gaza and the displacement of its people is a war crime in accordance with international law, so all The countries of the world rejected what Trump put forward.
He said: ""We are certain that the people of Gaza will remain steadfast on their soil, and Trump and (the Prime Minister of the Occupation Government Benjamin) will fail in their conspiracy and Gaza will be victorious."" He continued: ""Our proposal in accordance with the constitution, and he was sent to the presidency of the House of Representatives and then will be referred to the legal committee that will study it and return it to the parliament and then send to the government, if the House of Representatives, which supports the proposal, approved it, then the government must send it as a draft law to the House of Representatives for approval."" .
The Jordanian House of Representatives rejects attempts to displace the Palestinians
Regarding the deputies dealing with notes and proposing a draft law that prevents the displacement of Palestinians to Jordan, the journalist specializing in parliamentarian Jihad Al -Mansi indicated. In an interview, to Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed, that the parliamentary movement rejecting Trump's proposals resulted in two forms of parliamentary work, the first is a parliamentary note and the second is a proposal for a desire, and according to the internal system of the House of Representatives, the proposal with a desire means inviting the government to carry out any importance that falls within its jurisdiction. He explained that Article 141 of the internal system states that the member must submit the proposal with a desire to the Speaker of the House of Representatives in writing. By rejecting or accepting it, if the council agrees to it, it will be informed to the Speaker of Parliament and then to the Prime Minister. According to Article 143 of the Parliament's internal system, the Prime Minister must inform the council of what was stated in the proposal to which it was referred within a period not exceeding 30 days unless the council decides a shorter term.
Laith Nasrawin: The role of the House of Representatives, Qonna, the Jordanian position rejecting the liquidation of the Palestinian issue
Laith Nasrawin: The role of the House of Representatives, Qonna, the Jordanian position rejecting the liquidation of the Palestinian issue
On the parliamentary notes, Al -Mansi explained that it is a clarification For members of the Council on public issues or matters related to public affairs, and it is required to focus on a specific incident, with a specific number of members of the council, and if it is referred to the government, it will be answered within a period not exceeding 14 days from the date of referral. According to Al -Mansi, the precedents by submitting a law proposal by members of the House of Representatives are few, adding that these steps require time from the parliament and the government.
The position of the state is supportive of Jordanians
The former deputy, Jamil al -Nimri, considered to Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed that the position of the Jordanian state against the displacement of the Palestinians is strong, clear, decisively and completely by the Jordanians, as he is Arab supporter, and even many countries of the world and from Americans as well. He believed that the proposal of the law to prevent the displacement of the Palestinians is not related to Jordan or Jordanian citizens in the first place, and here we cannot assess the legal value of it, but receiving refugees is a sovereign decision for the state, which either allows or rejects it. He believed that the law proposal is political, and is consistent with the popular and governmental position that rejects the displacement, which is an additional positive factor for the position rejecting the displacement plans.
For his part, Professor of Constitutional Law and Dean of the Faculty of Law at Zaytuna University, Dr. Laith Nasrawin, to Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed, was that he was one of the first to propose this law, explaining that despite the increasing American pressure on Jordan to receive the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, the official position remained fixed and is based on recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to determine their fate and establish their state. Independent on his national soil, in accordance with international legitimacy decisions.
He added that the law is a new national mechanism that supports the Jordanian position, represented by the king and the government that shares with him the formation of the executive authority, from the Palestinian issue, and here the attention is directed towards the legislative authority that must exercise its constitutional role assigned to it as it includes an elected parliament from the people who express its will He exercises power in his name and on his behalf. He pointed out that the role of the House of Representatives, and after it, the Senate, is the code of the Jordanian position rejecting the liquidation of the Palestinian issue in a national legislative form that criminalizes any future decisions in this framework, imposing penalties on any of these actions, and considers it a form of great treason crimes.
According to Nasrawin, the positive consequences for issuing Jordanian legislation prevent the reception of the Palestinians and their housing outside their homeland are represented By adding a constitutional legitimacy to the firm position rejecting the proposal to transfer Palestinians outside their homeland, which Jordan law will consider a crime of ethnic cleansing according to international law and the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, which prohibits the forced transport of civilians in cases ethnic cleansing.
He said that Western countries, including America, present themselves as democratic countries that seek to promote individual freedoms and the right of the people to participate in making decisions related to public policy, and therefore the approval of a Jordanian law prohibits the displacement of Palestinians in accordance with the constitutional principles will be sent by a decisive national message that the Jordanian people, with their spectra, And all its components refuse to prejudice its national unity, and that it is keen to hold the cohesion of its internal forehead and not to destabilize its security And its stability in the event that its Palestinian brothers are forced to leave their motherland, which will have negative consequences for the Jordanian national security and its effects will extend towards the region and the world.
He believed that this trend based on the rehabilitation of the official position with constitutional laws adopted by the occupying power, as the Israeli Knesset issued many laws Which supported the position of extremist governments in the face of the Palestinians, by considering it legislation of a constitutional nature, due to the absence of a written constitution in Israel, and is based on it to give legitimacy to the colonial Zionist policy in Palestine, and therefore, the issuance of a Jordanian law that prevents the displacement of Palestinians from their lands is the best way to respond to These racist practices and repeated international demands for Jordan to accept the policy of forced displacement.

"Since the Nakba 1948, (Israel) has not stopped seeking to displace the Palestinians from their lands, whether through the war, or through systematic plans sometimes enjoyed American support. Over the course of decades, frequent projects appeared to resettle the Palestinians in neighboring countries, but they did not see the light due to the Palestinian, Arab and official rejection, and the Palestinian clinging to the right to stay on the ground despite all attempts to uproot them.
With the outbreak of the war on Gaza on October 7, 2023, the talk returned again about the displacement, to find its way to the international political scene through new proposals, which were not the first and will not be the last, but it all collided with two main workers: Palestinian steadfastness, and the Arab and international rejection of the idea of ??forced displacement.
History repeats itself
After declaring (Israel) in 1948, the Palestinians were subjected to a major catastrophe, which was displaced hundreds of thousands of their lands. With the increase in the number of refugees, their resettlement proposals began to appear in other Arab countries. In 1953, Washington launched the ""Sinai Plan"", which included the transfer of Palestinians to Egyptian lands, but it was met with official rejection.
In the 1960s, the role of Israeli Foreign Minister Igal Alon, who suggested deporting the Palestinians To Jordan and Egypt, but his plan was not achieved due to the lack of sufficient international support, in addition to the Arab peoples' rejection of these projects.
Enterprises are not completed
In 1970, Ariel Sharon, the then commander of the southern region of the Israeli army, adopted a plan to evacuate the Gaza Strip from its residents and deport them to Al -Arish in Sinai, but it failed due to political and field complications.
With the advent of the new millennium, talking about ""the alternative homeland"" returned through plans such as the proposal of the Israeli General Guarara Island in 2000, who called for Egypt's concessions in Sinai in favor of a Palestinian state, but Cairo categorically rejected. In 2004, the idea was repeated through a project presented by Joshua bin Arra, but he did not go into implementation.
In 2018, the most prominent American plan appeared in this context, as part of the ""Deal of the Century"", which proposed solutions to settle the Palestinians outside their lands, but it met an explicit Arab rejection, especially from Jordan and Egypt.
Gaza War 2023: New displacement attempts
With the intensification of the war on Gaza in October 2023, (Israel) returned to raise the issue of the displacement of the residents of the Gaza Strip, and this time through a ""secret document"" revealed by the newspaper ""Israel Today"", which spoke about plans to remove the Palestinians to Egypt. On October 17, 2023, the Israeli ""Mjafaf"" institute published a research paper calling for the unloading of Gaza from its residents, which was later supported by the Israeli extremist Finance Minister of Salail Smotrich, who called for the ""voluntary immigration"" of Gaza residents.
In December 2023, invitations returned again when the Israeli Channel 12 revealed that the former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, discussed with Israeli officials the possibility of moving the Palestinians from Gaza to Arab countries, which Blair later denied.
Trump restores the offering again
In 2025, former US President Donald Trump brought the issue to the fore, when he stated that ""Egypt and Jordan have to receive more Palestinian refugees,"" adding that the two countries ""will declare this because we are presenting them a lot."" These statements were widely rejected by Cairo and Amman, while the Israeli right was welcomed, headed by resigned National Security Minister Etamar bin Ghafir and Samotrich.
Arab and international rejection: an obstacle to displacement
Over the course of decades, attempts to displace the Palestinians categorically faced the Arab countries, especially Egypt and Jordan, as Cairo fears that any resettlement of the Palestinians in Sinai may pose a threat For its national security, while Jordan rejects the idea of ??the ""alternative homeland"" that threatens the population composition of the Kingdom.
The international community, including the United Nations and the International Court of Justice, rejected any forced demographic change in the occupied Palestinian territories, as the court demanded in July 2023 (Israel) to stop its procedures that lead to geographical or demographic changes in the Palestinian territories.
Repeated failure ... why?
All Israeli and American attempts to displace Palestinians from Gaza and other occupied areas have not succeeded for several reasons, most notably:
1. The categorical Palestinian rejection: The Palestinians consider the displacement a red line, and they see on staying on the ground as a form of resistance.
2. The decisive Arab position: Despite the pressure, no Arab country agreed to receive refugees as part of the Israeli displacement plans.
3. Legal and international challenges: International law prohibits forced displacement, and the International Court of Justice is a war crime.
4. Political and human cost: Any attempt to displace the Palestinians will lead to regional turmoil and perhaps greater conflicts, which is what the international community realizes.
Palestinian steadfastness outperforms plans Displacement
Despite the long decades of attempts, (Israel) nor its allies have succeeded in implementing the project to displace Palestinians, whether from Gaza or from any other part of the occupied Palestinian territories. The Palestinians remain adhering to their land, and history has proven that the policies of forced displacement will not pass before the steadfastness of a people who are accustomed to resisting the occupation by all possible means.",PS

For its part, the Fatah movement confirmed in a statement of its appreciation for the Arab position, especially in Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, regarding the projects of displacement, annexation and deportation, adding that this ""position will be in the way of displacement projects.""
In a shocking announcement, US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that the United States will control and possess Gaza, declaring that he intends to visit the besieged sector, Israel and Saudi Arabia, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu considered that the plan would change history. ""The United States will take control of the Gaza Strip and we will work there as well. We will have it. We will be responsible for dismantling all the unexploded bombs and other dangerous weapons on this site,"" Trump said at a joint press conference with Netanyahu at the conclusion of talks between them. He added: ""We will settle the site on the ground and find economic development,"" noting that his country is looking forward to Long -term ownership of the Gaza Strip, and said that this would create ""thousands of jobs.""
""I see that this will bring great stability to this part of the Middle East and perhaps the entire Middle East,"" he said, adding, ""This was not a decision taken lightly, everyone who spoke to him loves the idea that the United States owns this piece of land,"" adding that he imagines to live People from all over the world in Gaza after implementing his plan, expected to turn into ""Rvira Middle East"" and about the displacement plan. Trump said: ""I spoke to other leaders in the Middle East and their appearance of the idea of ??transporting the Palestinians from Gaza,"" and added: ""The leader of Egypt and Jordan will provide the land necessary for my plan for the Palestinians,"" in reference to his previous statements about the displacement of the residents of the Strip to Egypt and Jordan, and indicated that he did not take a position on The rule of the Israeli occupation on the West Bank and this will be announced in the coming weeks.
Regarding normalization, Trump expressed his belief that many countries will join ""very soon"" to ""Abraham Conventions"" to normalize with Israel, while Netanyahu expressed his confidence in his ability to reach an agreement to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia, indicating that he is committed By making it true, he said, ""I think peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia is not only possible, but I think it will be.""
Trump after Netanyahu's meeting: The United States will control and possess the Gaza Strip
The Haaretz newspaper believes that the main focus of the Trump administration is about progressing quickly to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia, which the United States considers a ""key"" for regional change, which is based on ""excluding Hamas, ending the Iranian nuclear project, and pumping money to the American market,"" noting that Trump's repeated statements Regarding the displacement of part of the residents of the Gaza Strip and their resettlement in Egypt and Jordan, it may be ""pure maneuver Negotiating ""; ""It allows Saudi Arabia to announce the failure of this scheme as part of the understandings with Washington on normalization.""
Indeed, the majority of the details of the future agreement are ""agreed in advance"" between the two parties, since the negotiations held during the era of the former US administration headed by Joe Biden. Under the understandings, ""Israel and Saudi Arabia will sign an normalization agreement that includes partnerships and economic cooperation,"" according to the newspaper.
The United States is leading diplomatic endeavors for months to carry Saudi Arabia, one of the most powerful and most powerful Arab countries An influence, to normalize and recognize relations with Israel. But the Israeli aggression on Gaza in October 2023, complicated this step.",UK
"US President Donald Trump repeated more than once and more than his way of talking about Gaza's evacuation of its inhabitants, as if these residents were just goods, as if this land is not their land. Moreover, as if this is a natural matter approved by international laws and laws. And because these hadiths are completely different from all of this, the regional and international reactions came clear and unambiguous in their absolute rejection. Among the rejectionists was China.
The Chinese rejection is not the Walid of these statements, but Beijing was permanently warning of such a scenario, whether it is partial or total, including the displacement within the Gaza Strip itself. She has been repeating her position since the last round of the conflict began on October 7, 2023. This tour had its own vision, which was not promoted for the Israelis or the Americans from the beginning. This was mainly due to China's reliance on initial matters and stable international references that do not want Tel Aviv or Washington to abide by it.
Moreover, she wants to get rid of them completely in the context of perceptions and maps that will only arise on the body of international law, before the bodies of the Palestinians. This initial Chinese position comes in light of a ruling framework to see to deal with The struggle for nearly eight decades in the event of looking at it since the establishment of Israel, which had its own visions regarding the disagreement of the cycle of violence rings that are almost not faded until it returns. The basis here is to address what Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called the ""bleeding in the conscience of humanity"", and the historical injustice of this wound to the Palestinian people. This people, which are entrusted with it alone, according to the Chinese logic, rule the rule of an independent sovereign state on the borders of the fourth of June 1967, including East Jerusalem, and of course Gaza, which China has been in the midst of what was proposed around the next day to stop the war on the assertion that whoever This is the Palestinians, not others. Hence, it was natural for the Chinese position to come clear, direct and consistent with the overall Chinese vision of the conflict and its settlement.
Donald Trump spoke in a short period of the deportation of the Palestinians from Gaza to Indonesia, then to Egypt and Jordan. Despite the categorical rejection from Egypt and Jordan, he returned and repeated the matter, and the situation reached him to talk about the imposition of American control over Gaza, and of course without the rhetoric of the displacement. These statements were not limited to their disapproval, including By international officials due to its danger and its content to the level of war crimes and genocide, but there is in the American interior to count on these statements as an entrance to isolate Trump from his position.
In this midst, the Chinese response came clear and frank and stated: ""We oppose the forced displacement of the people of Gaza, and we hope that the parties concerned will take advantage of the opportunity to stop the shooting and rule in Gaza after the conflict to restore the Palestinian issue to the right path of political settlement based on the two -state solution, in order to achieve Permanent peace in the Middle East. "" That is, the displacement of the Palestinians from Gaza, and accordingly, from other Palestinian territories is rejected. Not only that, but the Chinese message is clear to the parties concerned in terms of the necessity of returning the Palestinian issue to what it called the correct way to the political settlement. Thus, the Chinese assertion of the political settlement is evident while Trump talks about the political liquidation of the issue. It is the process that he started since his first term when he started moving the American embassy to Jerusalem. And here he continues with a series of negative messages not only towards Gaza and its people, but also towards the West Bank.
Chinese response Direct also guarantees an emphasis on the two -state solution. It is clear that neither Israel nor the Trump administration is concerned with such a solution. Whoever demands the displacement of the people of Gaza will not refrain from displacing the people of the West Bank. Hence, talking about stopping settlement and below entertaining issues becomes from Trump's point of view and administration. That administration, which targeted the first day of international organizations against the background of its positions on the war in Gaza, just as Israel does, and with the same arguments that the latter put forward.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lynn Jian, in his comment on February 5, 2025, was not satisfied with the issue of forced deportation of the Palestinians, but rather reaffirmed the principle of ""Palestinians rule Palestine"" as a basic principle of Gaza's rule after the war. There is a difference between those who talk about the rule of the Palestinians of Gaza after the war and who does not want to remain for the Palestinians in Gaza after the war. The next day, in the words of another spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Gu Jia Kun, the Chinese message came stronger: ""Gaza belongs to the Palestinian people, which is an integral part of the Palestinian territories, and not a bargaining paper in political games, as well as it is not prey to the powerful"" , Emphasizing that the state of destruction and suffering In which Gaza after the war requires solidarity to make the conditions in the Strip better. This solidarity should be international, headed by the major countries, so that the reconstruction process is carried out and the necessary and necessary humanitarian assistance is provided.
This clear Chinese position in responding to Trump's statements regarding the forced displacement of the Palestinians may say that it is the result of the state of conflict in American-Chinese relations. However, following the developments of the Chinese position on the Palestinian issue throughout its history proves that there is a clear Chinese position that rules a set of rules. This is what China expressed in the hadiths of its senior officials over the years, and in its positions in international organizations when presenting the Palestinian issue, and in the visions and initiatives it presented to deal with the overall issue and with the recent conflict round. In addition to what she did in the Palestinian reconciliation level. And if all of this does not mean that China has taken advantage of developments to expose Washington on more than one level, especially with regard to the latter's rash to protect human rights, while it is not satisfied with silence only in the event of killing and destroying the Palestinians in Gaza, but rather provides with financial and military support to Israel protection in Security Council by using veto. In all of this, it is a prolongation to extend the war that does not return to the Palestinians except with ruin, destruction, killing and displacement.
The intercourse will be postponed in some of the details of these rules to the next section, while the focus here is only on the issue of forced deportation of the Chinese discourse. In January of 2024, China warned via the Security Council not only of the danger of forced displacement, but also ""voluntary displacement"", as Zhang Jeon considered China's permanent representative at the United Nations that ""this means pushing two million people to leave Gaza and turn it into the so -called region Amna is free from the population. The two countries.
So, seeing China is clear regarding the speeches and repercussions of displacement, and for her, it is a horrific idea, a terrible crime, and more than that carries the destruction of a two -state solution. In the Pijin Paper Paper on the settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict on the thirtieth of November 2023, and as is evident from the date of the release of the paper, it came in the midst of the aggression on Gaza.  Hence, the four items The first of this document focused on how to deal with what it called the round of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. It was noticeable for the issue of displacement in particular that in the second item, which focused on ""protecting civilians with concrete steps"", this long sentence with a clear significance was received: ""The UN Security Council must continue to send a clear message confirming the refusal of the forced displacement of Palestinian civilians to avoid their displacement.""
It is clear that China rejects forced displacement within the sector. As the Israeli authorities were asking the Palestinians to leave places and go to what the safe areas called. It turned out that there is no longer a safe place in Gaza, and that the matter was in the context of a clear plan to make life in Gaza impossible. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was clear in the Security Council before his country issued this one -day paper to confirm that the protection of civilians ""a red line in international law cannot be overcome."" He also reaffirmed his country's opposition ""to the collective punishment of the inhabitants of Gaza, and the forced displacement targeting Palestinian civilians."" And he went on to ""that there are no safe places under the fire, and the Gaza Strip does not have a wall bodice"".
Then it was natural for the statement issued by the tenth ministerial meeting of the Arab-Chinese Forum at the end of the evil of May 2024 to ""refuse to implement the plans and attempts of forced displacement of the Palestinian people out of their land, which will lead to the collapse of peace opportunities in the Middle East, and expansion The conflict is exacerbated in the region.
This clear and principled Chinese position on the issue of displacement is consistent with what international organizations went to, including the Human Rights Council, where the High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk in February 2024 went to the fact that the comprehensive destruction of Israel, including the places that was not It has a fight that would lead to excessive displacement. ""It seems that it aims or leads to the return of civilians to these areas is impossible."" The United Nations was also clear in not participating in the crime of forced displacement. This came explicitly on the tongue of Stephen Dujarik, a spokesman for the United Nations in April 2024, at the time of talking about the Israeli invasion of Rafah after she had asked the residents of the north and central sector to go to it as a safe area, where Dujarric said: ""We are working in a conflict zone. We have full control of aid that can reach Gaza. What I can say to you is that we will not be a party to any forced displacement of people.
In its argument before the International Court of Justice regarding the request of the court’s consultative opinion regarding the legal consequences of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, China said that the occupying power force has obligations towards the occupied land and its inhabitants. Among these obligations are ""refraining from looting resources and property, forced or deportation of the population, the practice of apartheid, and the adoption of discriminatory legislation or any other violations.""
Two basic pillars on which the ruling framework of the Chinese logic is based on dealing with the Palestinian issue with all its ramifications, including the issue of forced displacement. The first of them is the justice of the Palestinian issue. Second, the victory of international law. China summarized this at the forefront of its previous pleading before the International Court of Justice, saying: "" Dealing with the Palestinian issue is a test of the collective conscience of humanity, the wisdom of the United Nations, and the authority of international law. Also, the Chinese Foreign Minister considered that ignoring the rights of the Palestinians, including the right to establish an independent sovereign state, as well The turmoil was repeated in what he called the Palestinian-Israeli situation.
As is well known, the refugee issue was among the issues of the final solution within the peace negotiations that started since the Madrid Peace Conference in 1991, and then the Oslo agreement in 1993. This process stopped completely. And now there is no talk about how to address the issue of the return of Palestinian refugees to their homes from which they were abandoned, but rather about the displacement of those who remained in Palestine. The Chinese minister in his speech on the dialogue of the Palestinian reconciliation hosted by his country in July 2024 considered that the Palestinian issue, which has not been resolved for more than seven decades, ""is a test of international justice, fairness, conscience and morals for humanity.""
China talks about the Palestinians as a people with stolen rights, those rights must be recovered. And at the top of these rights is his right to Decision of fate, and his right to establish an independent sovereign state. Hence, she recognized the Palestinian state and supported her joining as a United Nations observer, and supports her accession as a full membership member of the international organization. These main elements are found in the successive Chinese proposals. Beijing, according to President Xi Jinping, said that ""it is not permissible to absence justice forever."" Then China is with a political solution. This political solution must be accompanied by a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire. Also, this solution must be according to the international decisions issued by the Security Council regarding the Palestinian issue. This issue, which China considers its primary way to ""implement"" the two -state solution, restore legitimate Palestinian rights, and establish an independent state of Palestine with full sovereignty on the 1967 borders, and its capital, East Jerusalem. China sees the necessity of holding an expanded international conference for peace that is more credible and effective, and so that there is a specific timetable so that there will be a ""comprehensive, just and durable solution for the Palestinian issue.""
In this context, China's view of Palestinian resistance movements is completely clear and corresponds to the rules of international law as well. As the people who are subject to the occupation are the right to resistance in all ways, including the armed resistance. Hence, armed resistance and terrorism should not be confused. China will say that international rules are clear in this regard. Perhaps this is what made her not condemn the resistance factions after the Al -Aqsa Flood operation after the seventh of October. This caused the discontent of the United States and Israel a lot. The Chinese discourse was clear throughout the last round of the conflict in Gaza, in terms of refusing to target civilians, whatever they were. From this standpoint, China can be understood to host the fourteen Palestinian factions in Beijing for national reconciliation, which includes ending the division and strengthening Palestinian national unity. This Chinese sponsorship of Palestinian reconciliation while the war in Gaza was the most severe. Hence, Beijing emphasized three steps that you see interconnected, and does not sing one of them from the other, so that the stopping of fire and humanitarian relief operations comes as a top priority. Then comes the reconstruction of Gaza based on a basic principle that Palestine rule by the Palestinians. It is noteworthy here that the Chinese position paper regarding the settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict And issued about forty days after the outbreak of the war in Gaza, and about eight months before the Palestinian Reconciliation Conference in Beijing, it was concluded with an important significance for all the controversy currently in relation to the fate of the Palestinians in Gaza: ""Any arrangement about the future of the Gaza Strip must respect the will The Palestinian people and their independent choice, and it may not be imposed on it.
Some may view this Chinese framework as a traditional framework that has been overlooked by variables on the ground. However, the issue of imposing a fait accompli on rights holders has proven to be useless. Also, this framework, which some traditionally prepares, is the subject of extensive international acceptance, and there are international decisions on it. Not to mention that he talks about the minimum Palestinian rights. Others may go to the fact that this framework carries a lot and a lot of concessions, and a third team may have gone that it should not be accepted by the concessions of that named a traditional framework, given that opening the door for concessions may have brought matters to the explicit talk about the forced displacement of the Palestinians From their lands.
In conclusion, it is clear that China has a clear position in the absolute rejection of displacement Palestinians. It is also clear that since the outbreak of the last round of the conflict in Gaza, it has been aware that it might carry great dangers on the Palestinians and their presence. Hence, her continuous warning of the displacement operations, the statement of its categorical rejection of it, and its constant assertion that the fate of Gaza should be left in the hands of the Palestinians alone in light of the presence of international support to address the effects of the humanitarian catastrophe left by the conflict, and confirm that Gaza does not leave prey.
It is very important that the Palestinian file does not leave the parties that want to bury it completely, and it announces it explicitly that it is with the deportation of the Palestinians, and it is severely pressured on neighboring countries in order to accept the resettlement of the Palestinians in their lands. If the basis is the Palestinian adherence to the land, and then the Arab positions supporting the Palestinians, and rejecting any talk or discussion about the displacement of the Palestinians, then it is important to work on the formation of a wide international crowd in order for the Palestinians to obtain their legitimate rights. China is at the forefront of the countries that rely on its positions in this regard.",EG

"One of the biggest frustrations faced by Minister Etamar bin Ghaffir, after the announcement of the ceasefire was the stumbling of settlement projects in the northern Gaza Strip, which was promoting with others, based on the idea of ??displacing the residents of the region. These plans, which were supported by the plan of displacement, were frustrated with the steadfastness of the inhabitants of northern Gaza and their adherence to their land and homes.
However, when President Trump presented his random ideas about the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, the Zionist right has regained its momentum again, and his leaders began to talk again about their visions and how they were composing to Trump's proposals, whether regarding the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip or from the West Bank.
In fact, although the Zionist right was the most beneficial from Trump's statements about the displacement, the entire Zionist society welcomed Trump's ideas. The leaders of the Israeli opposition, known as the Central Camp in the Israeli occupation state, welcomed what Trump presented, including Yair Lapid, Benin Gantz and Avigdor Lieberman, who are leaders of the most prominent parties opposing the right -wing government in the Israeli occupation state.
As for the Palestinians, the various political components of the Israeli occupation state were not welcome With Trump's ideas, something new; The occupation state, its various components, mainly on the idea of ??forced displacement in 1948, and this matter made the displacement a firm tool in the Zionist thought in order to achieve what he claimed from its entity and independence.
The attempts of the displacement not stopped after the 1948 calamity, as the Israeli occupation presented in 1953 a new plan known as the ""Sinai Plan"", which aimed to deport the Palestinians to Sinai with American support. It was followed by the year 1967, the plan of Iagl Alon, which sought to displace the Palestinians to Egypt and Jordan, then the Ariel Sharon plan came in 1970, which aimed to transfer the residents of Gaza to Al -Arish and Sinai, which were under the Israeli occupation at the time.
In the new millennium there was at least 4 or 5 projects for displacement; Including the ""Guyra Island"" scheme in 2000 to establish a Palestinian state in the Sinai, and the Lieberman plan to displace the Palestinians in the West Bank in 2014, through the 2017 century deal that included the abolition of the right of return and displacement Forced in Gaza since the end of 2023 in Gaza, and at the end of 2024 in Jenin.
Besides penetration of an idea Forced displacement in the Israeli mentality, most of the displacement projects enjoyed American support since its beginnings. In 1949, during the administration of President Harry Truman, the US State Department assigned the diplomat George McGgy to study the possibility of deporting the Palestinians to Syria and Iraq, in a clear adoption of Zionist projects.
Over the course of contracts, from Truman to Clinton to Biden, American support for Zionist displacement ideas varies, whether in theory or on the ground. This support was not absent even in recent decades; Before Trump's arrival in his second term, the US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinkin, attempted to persuade Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi to open the Rafah crossing to enable the Palestinians to leave Gaza to Egypt, in conjunction with the start of the Israeli land aggression on the Strip in late 2023.
Trump's comments about the displacement were not new in the American policy supporting the Zionist displacement projects, but it carried its own character, which depends on the logic of commercial deals and reduced material reading. He dealt with the issue as if it was just a matter of providing housing, food and drink, regardless of the place, ignoring the dimensions Historical, political and humanitarian conflict. This approach reflects either ignorance of reality or a blind bias that transform without dealing with complex issues rationally and logical.
Although the Zionist right celebrated Trump's statements about the displacement of the Palestinians from Gaza, this enthusiasm will not be long. So soon he will realize that these ideas are not only illogical or applicable, but even recruiting all possible resources to implement them will not change anything from the matter. Fate accounts will show them that destabilizing regional stability will pose a greater threat to the security of Israel itself, which makes the factors that impede the implementation of these plans inherent in their same repercussions.
History confirms that all the forced displacement projects that the Zionist leaders have tried to implement, with the support of successive American administrations after 1948, ended with failure. This is due to the deep awareness of the Palestinian people and their adherence to their land, which was reinforced after the experience of the Nakba.
The Palestinian resistance also played a pivotal role in addressing these plans, adopting the narrative confrontation against Israeli projects targeting people, land and holy sites, regardless of the extent of support they enjoy from the global powers. Great.

He added, ""Al -Azhar renews its demand for all Arab and Islamic countries that it is necessary to take a brave and unified position against these rejected violations and empty statements that are trying to extract an inherent right of the rights of the Palestinians to establish their eternal state with its capital, Al -Quds Al -Sharif.""
Trump spoke, during a press conference, with the Prime Minister of the occupation Israeli Benjamin Netanyahu, on Tuesday evening, about his country's intention to seize the Gaza Strip, a few days after his call for the displacement of the people of the Strip and their resettlement in other countries such as Egypt and Jordan.

""The United States will take control of Gaza, and we will also make a mission in it,"" Trump said after his talks with Netanyahu at the White House, adding: ""We will launch an economic development plan (in the sector) aimed at providing an unlimited number of jobs and housing for the residents of the region.""
The US President claimed that Gaza ""could become (after his country's control and development of it) Rvira Middle East."" He also did not rule out the possibility of deploying American forces to support the reconstruction of Gaza, expecting the United States to be ""long -term ownership"" in the Gaza Strip.",QA
"The approval of the Israeli Knesset- with a preliminary reading- has passed a draft law that allows the Israelis to own lands in the West Bank without the approval of the army, without many noticing it or taking its right from discussion and analysis, it was absent amid the many events that accompanied it, coinciding with the third wave of the exchange of prisoners according to The ceasefire deal in Gaza, and with the announcement of the Al -Qassam Brigades, the martyrdom of its general chief of staff, Muhammad Al -Dhaif, and other events Associated.
Indeed, this project, which awaits the three stages of approval, is considered one of the most dangerous bills that the Israeli government approved today through its settlement arm of the religious Zionism Party led by Finance Minister Smotrich.
This is because the law, if approved, will have great repercussions on the legal status of the West Bank lands in a way that paves the way for the announcement of its entire inclusion, as happened previously with the occupied Syrian Golan Heights and with the east of the city of Jerusalem.
To understand the equation and its dimensions, we should return to the era of Jordanian rule of the West Bank areas before its occupation in 1967. Foreign funds from foreigners ""under No. 40 of 1953, according to which he was prevented from selling lands to non -Jordanians and Arabs, with the aim of protecting the lands of the state, which at that time included the West Bank areas, including eastern Jerusalem.
After the Israeli occupation of these areas in 1967, the military occupation law was applied to the West Bank except for the east of Jerusalem, which Israel declared annexation at that time without a real Arab or Islamic reaction, and the Israeli army became the one that rules the West Bank area as lands that are subject to the military occupation and not part From the State of Israel according to international law, where the world has not recognized any right for Israel in those regions, not even today.
Accordingly, the current status law was applied in the occupied areas, and the work of the aforementioned Jordanian law remained there, and after the establishment of the Palestinian Authority in 1994, the work of that Jordanian law kept to prevent the sale of the West Bank lands to the settlers, and Israel did not object to this, given that the Oslo agreement gave the authority The Palestinian authority has the authority to manage the ""A"" regions and the areas ""B"" in the West Bank, and Israel has not decided anything regarding the ""C"" regions that fall under its authority Administrative and security under the Oslo Agreement, because Israel has always presented itself before the world as a state of law, and that it does not exceed international laws.
Accordingly, and with Israel's desire to build settlements in the West Bank while preserving its ""legal"" image in front of the world, she resorted to circumventing Jordanian law at times to announce some lands military areas belonging to the army for security purposes, then the settlements are built as military areas, and sometimes by declaring some Public lands are ""state -owned"" under the auspices of the Israeli army.
Israel has established a civilian administration of the Israeli army responsible for allowing settlement and ownership of settlement units of institutions and companies registered with this administration, and the construction process in settlements has become proceeding accordingly, stipulating the approval of the Israeli army.
Let us note here that the presence of the Israeli army in the picture has always been an inevitable necessity; Considering these lands as a military occupy and not part of the state’s lands, even if Israel applies civil laws to what is inside the settlements, as they deal here with its citizens and not with the lands that remain under areas below Occupation!
All of these complications came to Israel to continue to show its image in front of global public opinion as being committed to international law, and that it respects the laws of the United Nations in dealing with the military occupied lands.
Here comes the new draft law, as this law eliminates the work of Jordanian Law No. 40 of 1953, that is, it eliminates the prohibition of selling lands in the West Bank directly to the settlers, and cancels the settlers ’need to establish companies or institutions accredited to the Israeli army in order to register those lands and real estate in their names. And it makes it possible for the settlers to buy and register any lands they want in the West Bank, just as one buys Among them, a land or a property in Tel Aviv, Haifa, or other lands that were occupied in 1948, which the world recognizes as the State of Israel.
Thus, the Israeli occupation army authority has been withdrawn from supervising the West Bank lands, and dealing with them as part of the lands of Israel just like the lands of the 1948 regions.
Here lies the seriousness of this The law, it means that Israel is simply no longer packed with international law or its image before the world, and this constitutes a shift in Israel's strategy in dealing with the institutions of the international community, a step added to pre -steps made by the Israeli occupation government during the war on Gaza in this context, such as UNHCR recognition is canceled.
Israel has become a ""muscular"" state, not a state of law, and it no longer cares about any image to the world, which means that it can do whatever it wants without an account of international law after it secured accounting as it seems under the new Trump administration allied with the religious Zionism stream.
This opens the door for the occupation government to exceed all the red lines in and around the Palestinian territories, and the first and most important and most dangerous of these lines in the West Bank is the process of annexing the West Bank to Israel, and trying to apply the idea of ??a transistor and ethnic cleansing to the inhabitants of the West Bank that was calling for the former Minister of Tourism, Rahbam Zeevi Which was assassinated by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in a Jerusalem hotel in 2001.
In fact, the first condemnation of the fire of this process will be Jordan who He will find himself in the face of an unprecedented storm that can destabilize his entire stability. This is not far from Trump's demands for Jordan and Egypt to receive the Gazans after ""moving them"", he said (which is the diluted formula from the phrase ""ethnic cleansing"") to these two countries.
In fact, the involvement of Jordan in this case, despite the distance of the geographical distance between it and the Gaza Strip, could be understood as a balloon as an introductory test for Jordan to accept the displacement of the Palestinians of the West Bank to it, in an effort to end the entire Palestinian issue, according to Trump's vision that is completely equal with the vision of the Israeli extremist right, Specifically, the religious Zionism stream, in which he found a trusted ally.
Approving this law can only be understood in the context of liquidating the Palestinian issue. The occupation government withdrew the powers of overseeing the occupied areas in the West Bank from the hands of the Israeli army, a clear indication of an Israeli intention that is no longer hidden to declare the inclusion of the West Bank.
It is obligatory for the Palestinian people first, and the Arab peoples in the countries of the collar second, and the official Arab and Islamic systems, led by Jordan third, to pay attention to the seriousness of this movement The feverish, the extremist right in Israel is not just a movement or party between multiple parties in the Knesset, but today is the actual Israeli state, and its aspirations and theses are no longer limited to it only, because it has a real support that believes in what this current believes in ideological, which is the American administration New.
It is not permissible in any way within the display of the nature of this new administration, nor to deal with the aspirations of the Israeli and American right as just dreams that can be prevented by international law. Republican Lindsay Graham during his visit to Jerusalem on November 27: ""The main Rome system is no It applies to Israel, the United States, France, Germany, or Great Britain, because we have not put it until we are targeting.
Thus, simply announce that they are above international law, for nothing but because they ""did not put it until they target them,"" according to Graham's words.
Therefore, it is necessary to anticipate the expected annexation process with real, deterrent political measures that go beyond condemnation Rejection of actual fusion with the peoples of the region and a change in the way the Palestinian issue is approached by the entire Arab Foundation, it is no longer a secret that the Israeli project not only wants to swallow the Palestinian territories, but also sees itself the right to expand at the expense of everyone.

"Those who have seen the history of Gaza are aware of how difficult it is to break and adapt. Gaza, which dazzled the world with its legendary steadfastness in front of the crimes of genocide for more than 15 months, has specifics that are unique and make it a cemetery for those who dare to invade it.
And Gaza ""This city, its name is engraved in the memory of history, was found with the existence of time, and the horrors of every fighting were ... in every era of a story, and in every battle of sacrifices and martyrs, and with every ruler of a story ... how much she condemned to Fateh and how much I have been disobeyed.""
Gaza, which has become wounded today and returned to its homes, even though the bombs and missiles of the Zionist aggression turned them into rubble and destroyed about 80% of them, so what fell on them exceeded what was bombed by German cities in World War II.
Despite the remnants of the Zionist aggression, the people of Gaza managed to bring their collective return to drop the displacement in a massive popular referendum, the nearby was amazed before the distant, although these will not find one of them did not lose dear but rather some of them lost all his family, yet the path continues with joy in the victory achieved by the Palestinian resistance that Netanyahu's plans, who filled his mouth more than he could chew when he set the war goals of ending the resistance The return of the prisoners, and the vision of Gaza reluctantly.
Although the occupation implemented the burned land policy to spread terror and fear among the people to force them to leave Gaza towards Sinai, the people of Gaza, with its women, youth, graying, and children, failed the plan of displacement with their legendary steadfastness.
This is the truth with the scenes of joy and a sense of dignity and pride, so that all those who were with Palestine and with Gaza are overwhelmed by the aggression that was aimed at exterminating everyone who moves on the blessed land of Gaza, shocking to the occupier who failed in all his military goals and was unable to achieve any success except in committing The massacres against civilians, which were the reason for the pursuit of the criminal Netanyahu and his former defense minister Gallant to the international courts and chased his army soldiers in A number of countries in the world.
The influential scenes that the Al -Jazeera screen for the people is overcoming the rubble of the destroyed homes and making their way to the effort towards their homes that the planes have settled on the ground as if they are returning to alternative palaces, this people are really the phoenix that comes out of the ash in the solid, strong and strong, the destruction and face the power of power and stands out and triumph .
The fact is that the scenes of the return return are a painful blow to the occupation, and it may be the best and the command of the military confrontations In which the resistance gave lessons that history will memorize and provide lessons in military institutes and universities.
With the return of the people to Gaza as a human flood, the displacement has fallen and the Zionists' dream has ended with the fact that killing and the commission of hideous crimes, the way to force the owners of the land to leave.
The Palestinian people do not forget the massacres committed in the 48 and 67, and criminal practices are not forgotten from killing and demolishing homes, comprehensive siege and prosecutions. All these practices are attached to the occupation. The dream of expelling the Palestinians from their lands and fields. Gaza towards Sinai as a single option to end a nightmare that has a threat Existential to the occupation, especially after the flood of Al -Aqsa, which ended a stage in which the enemy believed to be fortified and protected from any danger that comes from the Palestinian people and its valiant resistance.
What Gaza represents today with its impressive victory, the return of its people, the liberation of its families, and the playing of its children on the sands of the beaches of Gaza, confirms to the occupation and its partners that the land is for its owners and that all conspiracies will be broken on the rock of this people who, despite the pain and wounds, can turn sorrows into joys. People accept On life, as death does not fear in defense of his land and dignity.
The people of Gaza .. steadfast here
It is not the first time that the president returning to the White House, Donald Trump, is not the idea of ??displacing the Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt and Jordan. Perhaps the new in his speech, which he made from his plane, is that the Palestinian people, after he stood in the face of a barbaric aggression, is now in the moment of Habour and Azza.
After the Flood of Al -Aqsa, the world witnesses the chapters of a new flood with the liberation of the prisoners from the prisons of the occupation and what was left by the use of resistance with the prisoners of the Zionist enemy in a way in which it triumphed over values ??and morals, which left a positive resonance with the prisoners who called the resistance and their faces pronounced respect and appreciation to the resistance who committed to the ethics of wars even at the glory The Zionist barbarian aggression that did not exclude children, women and the elderly.
The resistance is folded by them, twice the rights of international humanitarian law and international human rights law.
Today we are witnessing with the whole world a human flood, which puts his pain behind him and rushes back to his homes, even though he realizes that the occupation is not a house, and no shelter is left. Also, the bombing and the aircraft are not successful to carry it to leave Gaza, as it is It also does not pay attention to a statement here and a statement there. In front of the people of the mighty, there is nothing impossible, adapts to suffering, stands up in wars, continues the liberation journey, and clings to their non -limited rights.
We are between two opposite scenes: scenes of joy and great victory, which was confirmed with the return of the people on foot to embrace the remaining families or even to remove the rubble from their martyrs and have mercy on them. The living remains and continues, and the martyrs are alive with their Lord.
On the other side, there is the scene of the occupation soldiers who left the Nazarem region defeated while weeping, after they were overwhelmed by a loss that will not be forgotten, and it will remain a disgrace to the forehead of soldiers who failed to fight the Ashous resistance fighters.
The goals of the aggression were bounced on the invaders, and American and Western support nor the official Arab silence. Today, even those who provided support and weapons generously for the occupation will have to express their dissatisfaction with the catastrophic failure that Netanyahu won after the Izzaladin Al -Qassam Brigades appeared with their strength and Hamas police spread in the destroyed Gaza streets, and the attempt to the Gaza Municipalities Union to open roads and displace the rubble with the available mechanisms that were not delivered as well. From the bombing of aircraft.
The occupation is after an operation The destructive sabotage behind it in the Gaza Strip was aimed at killing life and turning the place into a cemetery from which the smell of death smell. But the owners of the earth are deeply implanted in their soil and gained them in successive eternity, the jurisprudence of overcoming and the conquest of calamities.
The people of Gaza, who paid the price of their steadfastness, provided nearly 50 thousand martyrs and about 110,000 wounded, hundreds of prisoners and detainees, today they realize that they thwarted the conspiracy and failed the aggression and dropped the plan of displacement, and they have the right to be proud of their victory over the invaders and the occupiers.
The Flood of Al -Aqsa also brought back to the Palestinian cause, and also brought the flood of return the freedom of the free from all over the world. The statement of US President Donald Trump, who wants to displace Gaza residents to Egypt and Jordan, was considered by Senator Bernie Sanders to rise to a war crime, nor did Germany nor Europe welcomed the return of the population to their cities and villages in the Strip.
As for Egypt and Jordan concerned, which are targeted by displacement, they announced their absolute rejection of the idea of ??displacement and considered it a threat to stability and to undermine fair solutions to the Palestinian issue. She also saw the Palestinian presidency in the displacement plan to exceed each Red lines. The resistance factions expressed their categorical rejection of the displacement, and called on everyone to confront the firm projects and plans aimed at liquidating the issue of the Palestinian people.
in conclusion:
Trump, who promised to end wars, does not seem to be pregnant with a clear perception and strategy to manage a world that is attracting complicated disputes. There are no statements that included this country and the displacement of a people from its land and homeland, the international contract and the long conflicts are resolved. The people of Gaza returned with their flood, which washed away the plan of displacement, and repeated with one voice in a scene that will remain engraved in the memory, that we are returning to our homes and steadfastly on our land.

"As soon as the ceasefire agreement in Gaza and the exchange of hostages and prisoners is completed, Gaza has actually entered into the ""next day"" stage. But that stage has no clear features yet, except what President Donald Trump proposed to Egypt and Jordan, which is to receive more invading refugees in Egypt and Jordan because ""they have no shelter in the period of reconstruction."" It is a loose proposal, we know when it begins and we do not know when it ends.
Egypt and Jordan rejected Trump's proposal, as was condemned by other Arab countries in addition to the stakeholders because everyone saw in it forcibly an unconvincing migration.
War crime?
The Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, which is entrusted with forced displacement, is a war crime and prohibits the transfer of the population forcibly under any pretext, and sees any attempt to impose collective displacement an explicit violation of human rights and international law. Such a move will lead to extensive international condemnation and greater internationalization of the crisis, while increasing pressure on Israel and deepening the suffering of the Palestinians.
Is the possibility possible?
Politically, it is believed that it is very difficult for the displacement with the expectation of the spread of the reactions of the Arab countries, officially and popularly, especially in Egypt and Jordan, who realize the seriousness of this The plan that threatens their stability and national security. Collective displacement will be catastrophic from a humanitarian point of view, and causes unprecedented suffering with the absence of infrastructure to receive refugees.
On the popular level, every country that agrees to displace the Palestinians will discover that it threatens its national sovereignty itself, and will face internal and external pressures, and will be accused of collusion in liquidating the Palestinian issue, and participating in emptying Palestine from its residents, and this facilitates Israel imposing new facts without the need for any solution Politics that may be presented.
The repercussions on Palestine
The reality of forced displacement will lead to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian families amid harsh conditions such as the shortage of food, medicine and shelter, and the birth of a new catastrophe similar to the 1948 meal aimed at ending the Palestinian presence, ending the dream of a two -state solution, and following the loss of Palestinian national identity. Palestinian refugees will miss stability, as they are firm and national interconnection and the wide humanitarian and economic crises it follows.
The repercussions on Egypt
The first repercussions on Egypt threatening its national security. With large numbers of Palestinian refugees flowing almost The Sinai Island, the demographic structure will change and the security turmoil of the presence of armed groups in this region will be established. These groups may take advantage of the situation after the regime changed in Syria to increase their activities in the Sinai, and expose Egyptian security to unprecedented dangers.
Political and diplomatic repercussions
If Egypt agrees to this plan, it will first be accused of abandoning ""the first of the two kisses"", and in collusion in the liquidation of the Palestinian cause, and its relations with the Palestinians and the Arab world will be affected. On the other hand, this approval will ignite the wrath of the street inside and outside Egypt, and the Egyptians will refuse to settle the Palestinians in Sinai for national and historical reasons, just as most of them still reject the normalization with Israel for more than forty years. This may lead Egypt to strive with Israel to ward off the pressure of Arab public opinion.
The repercussions on Jordan
In Jordan, the first repercussions is the threat of political and social stability because more than 45% of the population of Jordan is of Palestinian descent and any new wave of displacement would create internal tension in which internal or external forces exploit this situation to stir up chaos or pressure on the Jordanian monarchy, and the threat of the serious threat The other It is the confirmation of Jordan as a ""alternative homeland"" and the threat of the Jordanian national identity. This is exactly what Jordan has consistently refused because it aims to get rid of the two -state solution at its expense.
Economic pressure
Jordan and Egypt suffer from economic problems. Egypt sees itself besieged by the Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the one hand, and the Sudanese and Libyan refugees and now the Palestinians, in addition to the low income of the Suez Canal, the rapid population growth and the deterioration of the value of the Egyptian currency towards the dollar. The unemployment rate in Jordan is high and estimated at 17%. If refugees flow from the Palestinian territories, these pressures will intensify on Jordanians, their economy, social services, and their infrastructure, and reflect more unemployment and the high cost of living.
Does Jordan and Egypt strengthen the rejection?
Let us assume that Jordan and Egypt closed their borders and failed forced displacement. Will Israel to dump into cruelty, similar to what it did in Gaza and Lebanon? Or may you resort to a greater military escalation to push the Palestinians to flee by any means, or to impose a more severe siege such as the use of starvation, fuel, medicine and water, an additional means of pressure?
A step of this kind expanded international support for the Palestinian issue, and not Especially in the corridors of the United Nations, and the possibility of more West is the possibility of the support of Israel. Or it prompts these countries to impose economic sanctions on them and to carry out an international and legal movement to try Israel on the war crimes they commit.
Therefore, the only solution that the United States must sponsor, as the great power, is to work to prevent the displacement of Palestinians and to support a fair political solution and pressure to stop Israeli attacks and lift the siege on the West Bank and Gaza and start reconstruction, which helps in a permanent political solution to the Palestinian issue Through the two -state solution, which is the proposed solution to end the Arab -Israeli conflict, according to the decision approved by the Security Council under No. 242, the date November 22, 1967 after the ""setback"".",PS
"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs affirmed Egypt's adherence to the principles and determinants of the political settlement of the Palestinian issue, stressing that it remains the central issue in the Middle East, and that the delay in its settlement and the end of the occupation and the return of the rights stolen to the Palestinian people is the basis of instability in the region.

Openness to all Palestinian
Oraib Al -Rantawi, head of the Jerusalem Center for Studies, believes in his interview with ""Arabi 21"", that US President Donald Trump has put Jordanian diplomacy face to face, in front of one of its worst nightmares by supporting the most extreme Israeli right thesis, to displace the Palestinians from their homes, and resolve their national cause At the expense of the Palestinians and Jordan, both.
Al -Rantawi said, ""Confronting this project requires strengthening internal fronts and opening up to all Palestinian forces to ensure a unified position. A unified Arab position should be moved not only to support Palestine, but to protect Jordan and Egypt's security and stability.""
He also stressed the importance of expanding the diplomatic move at the European and international levels to isolate the American position and reveal its danger, noting that the Arab experience with ""Israel"" proved that peace did not achieve the desired security, but rather opened the way for the extreme Israeli right to threaten the stability of the region, which requires a firm response It prevents the implementation of the Palestinian displacement project.
Declaration of war
Despite Trump's statement again that it is likely that the Egyptian President and the King of Jordan are likely to receive the Palestinians from Gaza, all that is issued by the two countries until now indicates a categorical rejection of this proposal, even if the official statement does not come in the form of a direct response to Trump.
As for popularity, the conversation has escalated through social media and in the political corridors, especially the House of Representatives, which emphasized the rejection of displacement projects, while the political opposition had a higher ceiling than Trump's direct speech through Statements to the general observer of the Muslim Brotherhood, Murad Al -Adayleh, to ""Arabi 21"", in which he described the proposal for displacement by declaring a war against the Jordanian state.
He added that there is no compromise on Jordan or Palestine, and there is no need for Jordanians with Trump's aid, noting that the Jordanian people will stand a shoulder to a shoulder with the army in facing threats and dangers on Jordan and thwarting the alternative homeland project, considering that the Palestinian people today who paid 50 thousand martyrs from their blood. To be a project for bargaining or displacement after his victory other than the course of history.
Al -Adayleh said that Trump's insistence on this project means expanding the battle of the flood to include the entire nation, adding: ""To take Trump the Jews with you to America.""
On the impact and economic pressures, Al -Adayleh said that this is an opportunity to adopt an economic policy based on self -sufficiency, which supports our national sovereignty, and Jordanians are ready to put a rock on their stomachs if it comes to the fate of their country.

Citizen for displacement projects and called for a return to a two -state solution to achieve security and stability in the region.

"Saudi Arabia hosts a mini -Arabic bite, gathering a number of Arab leaders to discuss an alternative plan for the proposal of US President Donald Trump, which calls for the transfer of the Palestinians from Sector to Egypt and Jordan. It is expected that the discussions will lead a copy of a plan presented by Egypt, including three stages.
Despite the importance of the summit, which produced a rare Arab consensus on the refusal of the displacement of the Palestinians, there may be disputes over those who will rule Gaza after the war and the issue of financing reconstruction in the destroyed sector.
""It is certain that this Arab summit will be the most important in connection with the broader Arab world and the issue of Palestine for decades,"" said Omar Karim, expert in Saudi Foreign Policy at the University of Birmingham, Omar Karim.
A source close to the Saudi government told Agence France -Presse that Arab leaders will discuss ""a plan for a re -reconstruction of Trump's plan on Gaza.""

Read closely to Arab leaders in Riyadh to discuss a response to the Trump plan about Gaza

It was scheduled that the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the Emirates, Qatar and Jordan were held in Riyadh Thursday, but it was postponed for one day, and expanded to include the Gulf Cooperation Council, along with Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority.
The close source said From the Saudi government, it will be on the table ""a copy of the Egyptian plan.""
The Jordanian monarch, Abdullah II, said last Tuesday to reporters in Washington that Egypt will provide in response to the Trump plan, noting that the Arab countries were discussing it after that in talks in Riyadh.
Egypt has not yet officially announced the details of its plan. But a former Egyptian diplomat talked about a plan from ""three stages being implemented on a period of three to five years.""
Reconstruction and financing is a sensitive issue at the top, especially with Trump's use of the difficulty of reconstruction due to the tremendous destruction, as a justification for removing its inhabitants until its rehabilitation.
Ambassador Mohamed Hegazy, a member of the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs, a research center based in Cairo and with strong links to the Egyptian decision -making circles, said that ""the first stage is the stage of early recovery and will last for six months.""
This stage includes ""the introduction of heavy equipment to remove the rubble, and three safe areas are identified within the sector that the Palestinians can be transferred to.""
Mobile houses will be provided with the continued flow of humanitarian aid during this stage, according to Hegazy, the former assistant of the Egyptian Foreign Minister.
""The second stage (...) requires DOLELIC conferences are the reconstruction that will happen as the population remains on the ground. ""
It also includes ""recycling of rubble for use as part of the construction concrete, and includes starting infrastructure work ... then building housing units and providing educational and health services.""
A United Nations report reported on Tuesday that the reconstruction of Gaza requires more than $ 53 billion, including more than 20 billion during the first three years.
The third stage of the Egyptian plan includes, according to Hegazy, ""the launch of a political path to implement the two -state solution and that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and an incentive for sustainable calm.""
Karim believes that this plan is based on ""a degree of unprecedented Arab unity"".
""The political weight of the entire Arab world is necessary to create an environment in which any American pressure can be tolerated.""
The issue of financing a plan of this size and the expected period for its implementation remains a major dilemma.
""The biggest challenge facing the Egyptian plan is how to finance it,"" said an Arab diplomat at the beginning of the ""biggest challenge facing the Egyptian plan is how to finance it."" He added that ""some countries, such as the bouquet, pump funding, perhaps for humanitarian reasons, but other Gulf states will set specific conditions before doing any declining.""
""I think the Saudis and the Emiratis are They will not spend any money if the Qataris and the Egyptians do not provide guarantees about Hamas. ""
The source close to the Saudi government explained that ""most of the leaders of the participating countries will attend the summit, but some will provide representatives.""
The participation of President Al -Fattah Al -Sisiououli, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the Emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Mishaal Al -Ahmad Al -Jaber Al -Sabah, has not been confirmed, while the participation of the Jordanian King Abdullah, who underwent surgery in Amman.
The Egyptian plan addresses a very thorny issue, which is supervision after the war on Gaza, which has been controlled by Hamas since 2007.
The Egyptian plan notes the formation of ""an unbiased Palestinian administration for any faction ... ((includes) experts and politically and legally followed the Palestinian National Authority.""
Hegazy also talked about ""a police force affiliated with the Palestinian Authority that is strengthened by Egyptian and Arab forces and from other countries."" Stressing that Hamas ""will retract the political scene in the coming period.""
On the other hand, the Saudi source stated that Riyadh believes that the ""Palestinian Authority"" should be the authority responsible for the Strip.
Qatar confirmed on Tuesday that the future of the sector is a Palestinian affair.
""I think all parties The regional realizes that any alternative plan they propose cannot include enthusiasm in any way, because the presence of Hamas will make it unacceptable for the American administration and Israel.
He added, ""Some matters inside the sector must change fundamentally in order for this (Egyptian) plan to have at least an opportunity.""
Attempts to force the Palestinians re -exit from the Gaza Strip to them are the memories of the ""Nakba"" when the establishment of the Israel state in 1948.

On foot or cars, the return march began to the home. The distance is not far for the residents of Gaza who were displaced 15 months ago. The sector is a small spot, but their journey today is only the beginning of an unknown future, after the heat destroyed their land.
It is not possible to imagine the extent of the destruction that caused the place and the humanitarian challenges it caused.
""There are no facilities, no services, no electricity, and no water,"" says Ghada Al -Kurd, who is preparing to return to the north of Deir Al -Balah.
""We have to rebuild everything from scratch.""
Urgent needs, such as food and shelter, are provided.

It is worth the end
The finding of a shelter in Gaza, which the war turned into ruins, will be one of The major difficulties, in the long run.
More than 700,000 people from Gaza City and its surrounding areas fled in the first weeks of the war, and perhaps about 400,000 people remained.
Some areas were completely removed from existence, while some features of life remained in other regions.
The United Nations estimates that 70 percent of the buildings in Gaza were either damaged or destroyed, since October 2023. The largest destruction occurred in the north.
Before the war, Jabalia was housing 200,000 people, half of whom lived in the oldest and largest refugee camp in Gaza. Today, it has been completely destroyed.
It is clear, for many, that the end of living in tents is still far.
The government media office of the Hamas movement in Gaza launched an urgent appeal to provide 135,000 tents.
The United Nations says it is now able to enter 20,000 tents, which have been stuck on the border, since August, along with a large amount of covers, but it has difficulty meeting the large demand for shelters.
""There are no sufficient quantities of tents made of relief operations anywhere in the world,"" says Rose.
Those who stayed in the north, throughout the war, fear that pressure on housing will worsen The return of civilians to the homes they left, more than a year ago.
""There is a big problem, because people were residing in the homes of their relatives or their friends in the south,"" says Asma, whose family escaped from Jabalia, but she did not leave the north.
""They now have to get out of these houses and return them to their owners. A new type of displacement has started.""
Asma says that three families are currently residing in their architecture. Three other families are expected to arrive soon. The narrowing of the place and the lack of privacy led to forms of tension among the population. ""
The repercussions of the return of refugees have become in daily life.
""I went to the market today to buy frozen fish, for the first time. I found the sellers raised the prices,"" Asma says.
The pressure is also expected to increase on water and electricity resources, already lost.
Despite all the difficulties on their way, the returnees speak, in terms of optimism, about their comfort, and the best future.
""We are very happy to return to the north, where we will find comfort,"" a BBC told the BBC.
She added: ""We leave behind the suffering that we were exposed to in the south, and we return to dignity in Beit Hanoun.""
According to Recent reports from Beit Hanoun, in the far northern Gaza Strip, on the border with Israel, the town has lost all its features.

But what about Donald Trump's proposal to deport people, temporarily or final, to Egypt or Jordan?
Egyptian and Jordanian officials rushed to condemn the proposal. Both countries fear social and security repercussions for the flow of immigrants fleeing the war, suddenly.
The Jordanian Foreign Minister, Ayman Al -Safadi, said: Jordan for Jordanians and Palestine for the Palestinians. ”His country is currently sheltering 2.4 million registered Palestinian refugees.
But Trump's proposal was enthusiastic among the members of the government, Benjamin Netanyahu, who belong to the extreme right.
The Minister of Finance described it as a clinic of Smotrich, who calls for the inclusion of the Gaza Strip to Israel and the construction of settlements in it, as a ""great idea.""
And last year, at a conference of his supporters, he spoke about the creation of conditions ""leading to a reduction in the population of Gaza in half in two years.""
Unless life to Gaza is no longer, and unless the people of Gaza find a glimmer of hope for a better future, Smotrich may have what he wants.
""I think they will wait for what will happen in the few months Next. If they lose everything, and reconstruction projects are disrupted, I do not think they will remain in Gaza. ""
Nearly 150,000 people have left the Strip since the war began, in October 2023.
Ghada believes that those who can leave, in search of a future for them in the Arab countries, or further of them, will follow them, while the poorest and weak ones will leave them.
""I agree with Trump that people deserve a better life. However, why is this life not in Gaza,"" she says.",UK

Forced for 1.5 million
Palestinian
from
Gaza
To Sinai or Jordan under the pretext of destroying the sector during
The war that lasted for more than 15 months; In a big political storm during the last period.
Trump was not satisfied with this request, but rather described
Trump suggests his ""cleansing of Gaza"", and therefore he is not ashamed to talk about cleansing
Ethnic in the context of his support for genocide, all of which are moral, humanitarian and international criminals,
But it strikes the wall with everything.
Trump was not satisfied with the statements
And demands, but rather began to take practical measures that explain how serious is in the absolute support of the entity
The Zionist, and that his talk about the displacement in the first week of his presidency will not be a storm
The media quickly calms or stops.
JATTEB abolished the decision of former President Joe
Biden suspended the supply of Israel with the deadly MK 84 bombs, which weighs at least a tons, which was used to invade Rafah in Gaza in May 2023.
He also lifted sanctions on settlers
The Israelis in the West Bank and threatened to attack the International Criminal Court for its issuance
Arrest orders against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Minister of Security
Yoaf Gallant.
These statements and attitudes are not Completely new, it is part of a long strategy to reshape the region's map to serve Israeli interests
In fact, these statements and attitudes
Not completely new, it is part of a long strategy to reshape the region's map
To serve the Israeli interests, Trump, in his first period, confessed to Jerusalem as an eternal capital
For the Zionist entity and the transfer of the American embassy to it and acknowledged the Zionist sovereignty over
The Golan, and finally he sought to implement the century deal during his first presidency and respond to it
Sisi
At least at least the media. In part of it, she was spending land exchange
between
Egypt
The Zionist entity, and the part that Israel will get from the Sinai is resettled
The Palestinians of the Gaza Strip.
Then Trump talked about the topic again
During his last election campaign, when he said that the area of ??Israel on the map appears
Small and you need to increase it, and you do not need to be smart to understand that it is intended to displace
To Sinai and Jordan, then finally these statements after assuming the presidency.
This introduction was necessary to understand that
Trump is serious about implementing the displacement plan, and that it will be his most important file in the Middle East during
His second and final presidency.
This file Sisi actually puts in trouble
Real between three main parties:
The anger of the Egyptian people known for its support
Historical for the Palestinian cause, and rejected any attempts to empty the Palestinian land from its residents,
Talking about the displacement of Palestinians to Sinai brings to mind ancient Israeli plans such as
""Alon Project"", which appeared after the occupation of Sinai in 1967.
Any implicit approval of this plan
It will be considered a major betrayal of the Egyptian and Islamic national conscience, and it will increase the size of popular anger
On Sisi, which threatens the stability of his rule.
From the military establishment, it is considered
The displacement file is a real red line for it, and the national security motive is not the reason for this;
Otherwise, we would not have seen something different from the military establishment in the file of waiving Tiran and Sanafir
Or the Renaissance Dam or other vital national security files.
The problem with the army, which works as a company
Large holding currently that the displacement does not only mean the transmission of the citizens of Gaza to Sinai, but the transfer
The Palestinian resistance is also with it to the Sinai, which means that Sinai turns into a point
The start of resistance against the Zionists with a great possibility to form a large Egyptian popular incubator
she has. Consequently, the army loses its control over the Sinai and may be This marked a popular revolution against him
It will not be able to repel it or absorb it this time, as well as its expected economic losses.
The resistance that was unable and failed
One of the strongest armies in the world and has the most powerful armies of the world; Certainly it will not be able
The Egyptian army will control it and it will be a losing battle by all standards.
Therefore, accepting the idea of ??displacement is a threat
Directly for the stability of the Sisi regime before the military establishment, especially in light of the displacement of leaders
A prominent like the team, Osama Askar, which may weaken the loyalty of the army to it and may turn against it.
Trump's pressure and Israel will increase on Sisi a lot in the coming period. The conditions from a Zionist point of view are perfect for salvation from the headache of Gaza and the West Bank and will not find such an opportunity again. This is how they think, so economic and political pressure on Egypt will continue, which will make Sisi in front of all options disastrous for him
So I think Trump's pressure and Israel
It will increase on Sisi a lot in the coming period, as the situation from a Zionist point of view is perfect
For salvation from the headache of Gaza and the West Bank and they will not find such an opportunity again. This is how they think, so
Economic and political pressure on Egypt will continue, which will make Sisi in front of options All
Disturb for him.
Approving the displacement means a clash with
The army, and it may be an opportunity for the army to take it off and download it for errors and disasters in the past period.
And if we assume that he was able to adapt the army
And his nails are trim to accept the deal at American Zionist pressures, so the resistance will move to Sinai,
Natural communication will happen between her and the Egyptian people and they will protect together, and the Sinai is inflamed as well as what
If the army suppresses or resisted the Palestinian people, it will be an additional reason for the boiling of the people
Al -Masry and the explosion of the situation internally, and it needs a signal only to ignite it due to the pressure
The growing economic and escalating political repression.
If Sisi rejects the displacement, it may be done
Economically pressure on it to the maximum degree, which may lead to the collapse of the situation and the ignition of a revolution against it,
Likewise - and this is a possible scenario - that Washington and Tel Aviv search for an alternative to
Inside the army, it can pass the displacement and use it to isolate Sisi and download it all the mistakes of the past,
With a good price in the form of economic aid to calm the street and pass the displacement at the same time.
Some of the scenarios ran say that
The displacement may not take place to Sina
In the Egyptian people In the internal provinces, but that will have endless security risks
Likewise, Egypt may turn into a large incubator for the resistance and the system lives the same dilemma and perhaps
worst.
Certainly, represented the majestic scene
And the historical of the return of the displaced Palestinian from the south of Gaza to the north
Displacement, and this is what we wish for, but what matters to us is that neither Trump nor Netanyahu and his government
They will stop stressing Egypt to pass the scheme completely and partially.
It is these pressures that will make a promise
The great Sinwar that the flood will change the Middle East, will be achieved, as these expected pressures are on
The Egyptian and Jordanian regime will make the impact of the Al -Aqsa battle not stop at Gaza and Lebanon
And only Syria, but it will soon extend to Egypt and perhaps Jordan as well, and to the Arab peoples
And its elites are to prepare for the selection of opportunities, as opportunities are not frequently repeated
And history respects only those who realize the jurisprudence of its time and place.",QA

"The statements of President Amirbonald Trammols, the displacement of the residents of the Gaza Strip and their resettlement in other countries, sparked angry reactions and anxiety between the Palestinians who reject all forms of displacement. The residents of the Strip consider these statements a direct threat to their existence and historical rights in their land, amid a popular, factional and official rejection of these statements, which affect the Palestinian rights fixed in their land and country.
The Palestinians who refuse for any form of displacement see that the plans for displacement and resettlement in other countries are only attempts to liquidate the issue, and to end their legitimate right to return to their cities, villages and their indigenous towns occupied by the Zionist gangs since 1948.
The Palestinian displaced returning to Gaza City after 15 months of war, Nihad Salem, 45, says he was not surprised by Trump's statements about the displacement of Gaza residents. The Palestinians used to repeated attempts to liquidate the just Palestinian issue. On the difference in these statements about its predecessors, Salem explains in an interview with ""Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed"" that she carries more pain due to its coincidence with the reality of death, murder, displacement, displacement and destruction experienced by the people of the Gaza Strip since the beginning of the war.
Salem shows that From a refugee family from the occupied town of Herbia, his grandfather has repeatedly told him, while he feels continuous nostalgia for returning to her. He says: ""We feel the meaning of true deprivation and we cannot repeat it again by obeying the desire to migrate outside Gaza. Gaza is our current home, and we will not leave it, whatever happens.""
For his part, the Palestinian Hossam Al -Firani believes that Trump's statements are not very different from the Israeli evacuation orders that followed the Palestinians throughout the war, or from the Palestinian catastrophe that deprived the Palestinians of their cities and villages after the Zionist gangs seized them on the impact of massacres and blood. Al -Firani indicates to Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed that the Palestinians are still adhering to their destroyed housing and residential areas, amid harsh living conditions where there are no elements of life, stressing that this adherence is the definitive evidence of the unwillingness to neglect and emigrate.
In turn, the Palestinian Souad Ghannam shows that Trump's statements are not just a ""political proposal"", but rather gave a political cover for those who seek to displace the Palestinians by force, which would exacerbate the difficult living conditions of the Palestinians who are already suffering from a lack of ingredients life.

""Gaza is not just a geographical spot, and it cannot be left under any circumstances,"" says Ghannam. While Palestinian Sondos Ashour, 28, explains to Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed that she was angry at the moment of Trump's statements at a time when her family was preparing to return to the northern regions of the Gaza Strip, which reflects the clear difference between the Palestinian desire and attempts to liquidate his case.
""All the time we dream of building our future here, in our homeland, but they want to make us refugees forever, I cannot imagine that I will leave Gaza, to live in another country that I do not know, this is our land, and we will stay in it despite everything.""
Trump's plan on Gaza is shocking: Arab and international rejection and an Israeli welcome
Ancient political orientations
And political science professor Saeed Hammad explains Trump's statements at this sensitive time It reflects old political orientations to empty Palestine from its residents, and he says: ""When an American president declares such words, he opens the door for international and regional powers to think about the implementation of these plans."" Hammad explains to Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed that the Palestinians are going through a stage of weakness after a devastating murderer, and what is going on is attempts to exploit that weakness to impose unfair agendas and solutions, stressing at the same time that the secret of the Palestinian power is his steadfastness on his land and his refusal to leave under any circumstance.
Hammad believes that it is difficult to achieve the scenario of mass displacement in light of the absolute Palestinian rejection, in addition to the supporting Arab and international positions specifically from Jordan and Egypt, but difficult living pressures and the lack of horizon may push and encourage individual migration, which some forces seek. It stresses the necessity of strengthening and strengthening resilience within the Gaza Strip by resolving living conditions, reconstruction of the sector, and compensating the Palestinians as part of their losses in the current stage, as well as finding practical solutions to various problems, foremost of which is housing, food and drink, to discourage them from the option of forced immigration.
Palestinian factions condemned Trump's statements, center Confirmations that the attempts of displacement will not succeed, and that the people of the Gaza Strip will only leave to their original cities and villages from which they were abandoned, while Arab and international reactions, rejecting the displacement of the residents of Gaza, and calling for a solution to the Palestinian issue on the basis of the two -state solution.",UK

""Middle East Eye"" to Terry British US President Donald's plan
Trump
, To displace the residents of the sector
Gaza
.
The writer said that the so -called Gaza ""cleaning"" plan is consistent with the long -time thinking of the Zionist movement, and more accurately, with the goals of the war set by the extremist Israeli right.
He added: ""This ethnic cleansing will pave the way for Jewish colonial colonial projects, and to turn Gaza into a technological center for everything related to the future, which is still dreaming of Netanyahu.""
He explained: ""Through this plan, Trump is identical to the long -term movement of Zionism, more precisely, with the goals of the war that the extremist right was placed in Israel.""
The following is the text of the article:
On Sunday, US President Donald Trump proposed resettlement of one and a half million Palestinians from Gaza residents in Jordan or in Iraq, as part of a plan for ""only cleaning"" the sector. Rather, his private envoy to the Middle East suggested Steve Wittouf resettling part of the Gaza population in Indonesia.
In a tweet via the X platform, Itamar Bin Ghaffir, the far -right and the former National Security Minister in Israel, expressed his support for the Trump proposal.
Bin Ghafir wrote: ""One of our demands by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to encourage voluntary immigration. When the head of the largest major power in the world suggests this idea, this deserves the Israeli government to implement it - encouraging immigration now.""
This ethnic cleansing will pave the way for Jewish colonial projects and transform Gaza into a technology center for everything related to the future, which is still dreaming of Netanyahu.
Through this plan, Trump is identical to the long -term movement of Zionism, more precisely, with the goals of the war that the extremist right was placed in Israel.
On the twentieth of December, Bin Ghafir had again mentioned his proposal, which is to ""encourage voluntary immigration"" for the inhabitants of Gaza so that the Palestinian region, from which the Israelis withdrew in 2005.
And from his point of view it is an urgent necessity to preserve the security of Israel, as it is a better solution for the residents residing in Gaza, and he said: ""Gaza is unhealthy, while other countries need the workforce, and therefore it is better for them to be there.""
That was not the first time since the war on October 7, 2023, was proposed In which the far -right minister has this idea.
For example, on the fourteenth of May 2024, Bin Ghafir made his proposal within a human framework, when he said: ""Encourage the voluntary migration of the residents of Gaza ... that is moral, and it is a rational choice, and it is also right.""
The ""return"" of the Jews to Gaza will be an investigation of a prophecy and fairness of the Jewish people, which was expressed by Bin Ghafir by saying: ""We must return to the homeland, because that is what the Torah requires, and that is the moral work, and that is historical justice, that is Logic, and that is the right verb. ""
On the same occasion, he went further than that, Israeli parliament member Zafi Sokut, a member of the Zionist Religious Party, went when he said: “Tell the countries of the world who sympathize with morality in hydrophia with the Gazans that they [that is, the Palestinians of Gaza] will be safer with them in other countries. If they are They love them to this extent, South Africa should take the inhabitants of Jabalia. ""
As is evident from Sunday's comments, the ceasefire did not change fundamentally from this vision, which dates back to the origin of Zionism.
One hundred thousand Arabs in Gaza, not 2 million
Despite some dissatisfaction by the Israeli opposition and even the states United in President Joe Biden, but again in the history of Israeli colonialism, the project is pushed through the war, within the policy of imposing the fait accompli.
In particular, this was the situation in northern Gaza, where the army regularly implemented a plan to expel, exterminate and resettle the Palestinians, pursuant to the recommendations that were received in the so -called Island plan, or the general plan, which was developed by a group of senior reserve officers in order to purify the area ethnically.
There is no doubt that for many Israeli leaders, leaving the majority of the Palestinians of Gaza is the logical result of military operations, even if it is gradually achieved.
This was not hidden by Finance Minister Paisalel Smotrich in a statement issued in December 2023, when he said: ""What should happen in the Gaza Strip is to encourage immigration."" He added: ""If the Arab population in Gaza was one hundred or two hundred thousand, instead of two million, then the discussion about the next day will be completely different.""
The idea has become part of the general debate inside Israel, according to an opinion poll that was presented early in 2024 in a conference organized under the title ""Lessons from Gaza - the end of the idea of ??a solution The two countries, ""in response to the question"" Are you with or against the voluntary displacement of the inhabitants of the Gaza Strip to other countries? "", 76 percent of the poll participants said they support this - and this is a majority that represents all components of the political spectrum.
The fact that the Israeli public is asked to report what the Palestinians will want to reveal the extent to which these Palestinians are stripped of their right to be active in making their history.
It is not surprising that the Israelis have the desire to see the Arabs disappear and leave the scene empty in front of the Jewish state that includes Gaza and the West Bank and even the Syrian Golan Heights and the southern West Bank of the Litani River in Lebanon. However, the idea of ??""voluntary"" migration, on the other hand, seems more contradictory.
If we take into account the violence practiced for the starvation of the population, the systematic destruction of all the infrastructure necessary for life, and the elimination of any possibility of a future return to northern Gaza, the idea of ??""voluntary"" departure seems as if it was a term derived from the eu -language dictionary.
They fold their tents and leave silently
However, this is still part of the selection of the means that the founding fathers of the state thought Judaism, as witnessed by the research work carried out by the British Palestinian historian Nour Masalha about the continuity of ""the concept of transistor in Zionist political thought.""
Through the slogan ""Land without a people for a people without a land"", which is the slogan that Israel formulated Zanguel, one of the first organizers of the Zionist movement in Britain, the Zionist leaders sought to deny the existence of a resident people in that land.
However, the Arab presence has been considered an obstacle. This was expressed by Zanguel himself through a false claim in 1916, when he claimed, as he was quoted as a reconciliation, that ""removing the Arabs from Palestine to provide the necessary space to settle the European Jewish masses is a prerequisite for achieving Zionism.""
In a vision packed with Orientalist biases, Zanguel wrote in 1920 saying: “We cannot allow the Arabs to impeding a very valuable piece of historical redevelopment ... And accordingly, we must gently persuade them to immigrate. In the end, they have all the Arabian Peninsula with its area of ??one million Square. Silently, let them comply with that now. ""
However, the dreamer that The Arabs who are from the ancient Hebrews want to return to their ancient religion, as Ben Gurion wrote in 1918 before the idea was erased from the Zionist narrative, or, in contrast to that, that they are not related to the land ""which was promised"" to the Jewish people, according to the formula that Without Herzl in 1895 in his memoirs, he was dispersed to give way to a more realistic understanding.
Indeed, there was no chance that the Arabs could voluntarily give up Jewish immigrants for fertile lands that they still have unlawful after generation.
""The Arab tribes were removed with the sword,"" as Zanguel expressed in 1905 was not an option, due to the lack of the necessary power. Consequently, the minds of the leaders of the Zionist movement occupied the following question: How can the Arabs of Palestine be pregnant, whose national awareness was growing and strengthened by the tensions resulting from the extraction of the land from them, to leave ""voluntarily"".

Do not leave them with an option other than immigration
This reached the peak in 1937 when the Bill committee, which was sent by the British government after the Arab Revolution in 1936, proposed on the one hand dividing Palestine into two states, and on the other hand the transfer of the Arab population to Outside the area designated for the Jewish state.
After a fierce discussion, the Zurich Conference of the Zionist Global Organization rejected a plan that restricts the movement's expansionist ambitions, which claimed the right to Palestine as a whole, without commitment to the British government to deploy forces that guarantee the completion of the transportation process.
The Zionist leaders did not mean the phrase ""voluntary"" immigration that gave individuals freedom of choice, but rather the result that resulted from a set of measures that have no choice but to immigrate.
As Malah is mentioned, Johuhua Subarsky, the leader of the public Zionists in Palestine, suggested that by overseeing citizenship within the state during the transitional period, imposing agricultural legislation, which is intended to confiscate large areas of Arab lands and prevent Arabs from buying the land inside the country, a huge number of The Arabs will leave the land of Israel. ""
Perlene, leader of the Zionist Zionist Party, suggested to her, Knesset Zeral and a member of the Zionist Labor Committee, that taxes should be increased until the Arabs are forced to flee because of the burden of taxes. ""
It was not the approval of individuals that they were seeking to obtain, but rather the approval of the leaders of the neighboring Arab countries, who were subjected to By the British Empire, such as Abdullah bin Al -Hussein (Emir of Eastern Jordan) or his brother Faisal bin Al -Hussein (King of Iraq), who was not in front of the financial aid he received only to agree to welcome this new population bloc.
One of the most sophisticated plans, which have received great attention from the Zionist leaders, as well as from the American and British authorities alike, until the mid-1940s, is the one that Edward A Norman (1900-1955), a Jewish billionaire residing in New York, has developed his wealth. And his political activity to support the Jewish population in Palestine before 1948, according to what was mentioned.
His idea was to organize resettlement in the Shatt al -Ghrouf, which is located in the heart of the fertile plains of Iraq, instead of the eastern bank of the Jordan River, which, according to it, should not be given the Jews and become forever outside their colonial region. Looking at the number of Jews who need migration from Europe, they are expected to need it.
The purpose of some of these projects was to have a human nature, but they are actually weaving fiction. It was not taking into account the awareness of the Palestinians And their sense of belonging to Earth.
The idea that Ben Gurion formulated, for example in 1941, according to which the land of Israel is just a small piece of land inhabited by the Arabs, and that the Arabs in the land of Israel are just a very small group of Arabic -speaking peoples, it is one of the permanent characteristics of the Zionist understanding The Palestinian Arabs are linked to their land.
Tensions resulting from the expulsion of the Palestinians through a terrorist campaign that led its leaders, starting in 1947, the Zionist militias, the Ergon, Stern and the Haganah, finally led to the confrontation in 1948 between Israel and the neighboring Arab countries (
Egypt
Syria, Jordan and race).
Three quarters of the Arabs who lived in the land of the Jewish state (which expanded during the events) were expelled, and thus the ""Arab Question"" miraculously was resolved, in most cases.
Then the Israeli propaganda later fabricated the ""voluntary"" legend of the Palestinians at the invitation of Arab leaders, to leave the field open to military operations to return after achieving victory. As they have suffered a defeat, they lost any legitimate right to return to their homeland. This is a legend that the Palestinian historians have not They entered it, then they joined them with the so -called new historians in Israel.
After 1967, Gaza emptying
The Arab issue emerged at other times after the 1967 war and the resulting new occupations, including the Gaza Strip. Odir Adirit, a journalist in Haretz, documented Israeli plans to transfer the residents of the recently invaded areas. Once again, Israeli rulers sought to obtain a ""voluntary migration"" to Sinai or Jordan, to keep only seventy thousand or one hundred thousand Palestinians in Gaza.
Aderet wrote that the idea of ??the Israeli Prime Minister, Levi Ashkol, was serving a quiet migration in a way that does not seem to have been related to the matter.
He adds that the Israelis, with their security background, who were aware of the Palestinian society, were sent directly to the population gatherings in Gaza in order to persuade its leaders to encourage people to leave voluntary. The Prime Minister believed that the Arabs may have gone out of the sector automatically due to the suffocating situation and the siege they were exposed to there.
But the Palestinians of Gaza have remained steadfast, do not affect these attempts.
In 1971, Defense Minister Moshe Dayan formulated a faster version of ""voluntary"" immigration, saying: ""will We give them 48 hours to leave, and we will tell them, for example, you will move to Al -Arish [in Sinai] or anywhere else, we will provide you with transportation. Initially, they give them a voluntary transition option. Leave the house from the furniture. If a person does not come to arrange his conditions - we bring the bulldozer to demolish the house.
If there are people inside the house, we take them out of it. Since we give them 48 hours, there is no critical moment here when it comes and says we and your furniture will carry you in the truck, but you give them the opportunity to do this voluntarily. ""
This process remembers what the Spanish invaders were doing in the face of the indigenous people in pre -Colombia civilizations. Where before heading towards the battle, they read a list of conditions on them and suggested that they convert to the Catholic religion, which is completely strange to their world.
If they refused, the Spaniards threatened them, saying: ""We will invade you by force, we will launch a war for you everywhere, and in all ways."" Given that the indigenous people were refusing, this considered this a declaration of the demonic natures, which was justifying dealing with them with the most severe types of violence, and considered it a legal and moral practice.

We can recall from this historical glimpse of the fixed specifications of the idea of ??""voluntary migration"". It is based on denying the right of the other to have a vision that expresses it or aspirations that it is aspired to, but rather that it is destroyed in the face of what is being accomplished by a goal that claims to itself moral superiority (with its sanctuary to the Jews victims of persecution).
Keeping the lies of a potential voluntary choice allows the responsibility of the Palestinians to be held by the misery they receive if they insist on not leaving, then download it to the Arab countries accused of refusing to accept the refugees based on a political calculation and hostility to Israel, and then to the Jews themselves.
In the end, he takes responsibility for organizations that Israel considers an existential threat, such as the UNRWA, which has been accused by Israel since its foundation in 1948 of maintaining a living refugee issue. This is the reason for which last October was enacted a law prohibiting the work of the United Nations Agency specializing in helping Palestinian refugees in Israeli territory.
The ""voluntary"" immigration option is allowed to clear a project that includes the displacement of a people from its land and at the same time preserving the moral purity of those They do it. But in practice, it is only one of the dimensions of the policy of transmission, and it is after its soft nature acquires the balance of power, in one way or another.
When the Palestinians of Gaza refused to leave in 1970, the Minister of Religious Affairs, Zorge and Warshafegh, said at the time, addressing Prime Minister Golda Meir: ""It will be better to use force if there is a need for power, but only amid a state of chaos.""
And the people of Gaza are still today, and despite what the Israeli army committed against them for 15 months, they refuse the voluntary departure from what they consider their homeland.
Unless a sustainable political framework is reached, the project to seize the Gaza Strip and remove most of the Palestinians from it in preparation for resettlement of the Jews in it remains in the minds of a huge sector of the Israeli political class, and it remains as an ambition that the settlement organizations seek to achieve - and it may be a strategic target of a crisis that is detonated in the future.
This is exactly what the government and the army began completing in the north during their recent war in the Strip.

"Prior to the meeting of US President Donald Trump with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in early February, the Israeli media considered that the meeting is the most important since the beginning of the extermination war on Gaza, and its expansion of the West Bank and Lebanon, and that it will carry results that affect the course of the ceasefire and the fate The Gaza Strip, and perhaps the fate of the entire region. However, no one expected the meeting to turn into a clear and public American declaration by the US President himself calling for the displacement of the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, and thus gives legitimacy to the displacement projects that the oath calls in Israel.
Israeli society in general, right and Netanyahu in particular, celebrated this declaration and saw that it was a historical transformation in the policies of the United States towards the Palestinian -Israeli conflict, and an opportunity to implement its plans and projects to displace the population of Gaza.
The opposition welcomes the plan to displace the Palestinians
However, welcoming the Trump plan for the displacement of the Palestinians was not limited to the currents and parties of the far -right, but also the opposition parties, which include parties that define themselves as middle -right parties, such as ""the official camp"" headed by Bani Gantz, and ""there is a future"" headed by Yair Lapid, and the ""Democrats"", which defines itself as a Zionist left party, which was formed less than a year ago as a result of the merger of the ""work"" and ""Mertz"" party.
Mahmoud Muhareb pointed out that the origins of the displacement plans have committed the displacement policies since the beginning of the Zionist project

Gantz welcomed the Trump project to displace the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, saying that he presented ""creative, original and interesting thinking and must be examined."" For his part, Lapid said that Trump and Netanyahu's joint press conference was ""good for the State of Israel.""
As for Yair Golan, head of the ""Democrats"" party, he tried to be distinguished by his position on the rest of the parties, and presented a position opposing the plan, even shy, and linking the refusal with the importance of achieving the goals of the war and returning the detainees. Golan's response came through an article in the Haaretz newspaper on the ninth of February, saying, ""The idea of ??displacement contradicts Judaism and Zionism ... and everyone who considers himself Zionist must oppose and stand against this project so that it does not turn into legal and natural in the Israeli discourse."" And he believed that these projects keep Israel away from its basic tasks, which are Returning the prisoners and finding an alternative to the rule of Hamas in Gaza, and dealing with the ""extremist Arab axis"", and that in the end, every Israeli must understand that his fate lives alongside the Palestinians.
Israel continues its efforts to implement the Trump plan to displace Gaza: the mechanism and timing
The positions of the opposition parties towards the Trump plan can not be considered new or strange, as these parties ignored the voices calling for the displacement of the residents of the Gaza Strip within Israeli society and decision makers, which started directly in the first days after the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, which claimed that The displacement of the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip is the only solution to the emerging situation after the seventh of October, and that all Gaza residents are accused of supporting Hamas, Rather, a large part of them participated in the attack. Nor can it be ignored by the fact that the proposals of the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza are not new to the thought and offered the center -right parties or the Zionist left. According to the researcher Mahmoud Muhareb, who dates back to the origins of plans and thought of displacement in the Zionist mentality, the policies of the Zionist project were necessary from its inception and continued after the occupation of the Palestinian territories in 1967, by means Several, and here they are floating on the surface again from the first day of the war on Gaza (the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies).
The idea of ??the transcript accompanied the Zionist movement from its beginnings
Journalist Shaul Arieli, in an article in the Haaretz newspaper on February 12, said that the idea of ??the transcript ""accompanied the Zionist movement from its beginnings, and it was an integral part of the strategic thinking of its leaders ... Although the Zionist movement was initially assumed that the Jewish majority in the land of Israel will be fulfilled In the first place through collective Jewish immigration, it has never hesitate to study the possibility of establishing a Jewish majority By moving part of the Arab population outside the limits of what was supposed to be the Jewish national homeland. "" According to Arieli, there are three basic lessons that can be learned from reviewing the history of the idea of ??a transistor: First, it is not a marginal or extremist idea according to the concepts of the Zionist project, and secondly, the idea gained its legitimacy by international elements, especially in the period between the two world wars, and third, even When the idea seemed to be abandoned, it remained in place and has an impact on decision makers. We have to face The truth is that the idea of ??a transistor was exclusive to ""extremists"" alone. He supported this idea in one way or another, leaders of different Zionist political spectrum, and even those described as ""moderate"", they saw a legitimate solution.
Historical leaders support for displacement projects
In an article on December 3, 2024, the journalist in the Haaretz Ofer newspaper, in an article on December 3, 2024, reviewed the positions of historic Israeli leaders and their support for displacement projects, including David bin Gurion. Awar was quoted from the book of the Israeli historian Tom Segag, ""The Days of Al -Numan Shiites"", where he wrote: ""With the exception of a few, there was no disagreement that forced displacement was desirable in relation to the Zionist movement, and he considered it an ethical ... This was indeed the Zionist dream in its essence."" . Reviews of the protocols of the Israeli government have been revealed since the 1960s and 1970s, according to Awar, which an Israeli considered to be a left government led by the Labor Party, that the heads of government and ministers met several times to discuss the problem of the Palestinian population in Gaza, and ideas and projects were not very different from the ideas of the extreme right today. Adrat concluded that the current ambition of the extreme right to ""encourage immigration"" The Palestinians from the Gaza Strip do not reflect the ideas and proposals that were previously presented for the discussion of the past by the heads of government, ministers and leaders of left -wing governments, belonging to the founding generation of the state.
Gaza suffocate to push residents to migrate
Gadi Al -Ghazi: Gaza strangled Gaza is a systematic way to push residents to forced migration
Gadi Al -Ghazi: Gaza strangled Gaza is a systematic way to push residents to forced migration
The anti -Zionist historian Gadi Al -Ghazi (Siha McComite website on February 16) said that the ""voluntary displacement"" efforts from the Gaza Strip did not stop over the past long years, as the strangling of the Gaza Strip through the siege was only a systematic means to push the population to Forced immigration and forcing them to leave the area. The ultimate goal is to complete the previous attempts of Israel to empty the Gaza Strip from its Palestinian population, especially the refugees, which have achieved partial success during the period between 1967 and 1973. Since October 2023, the project entered its second phase: random shelling, mass displacement during the war, and systematic destruction of everything that can be destroyed. What the Trump plan says in its essence is that the next stage will witness an additional escalation, but this time Under the auspices of imperialism.
Journalist Mirun Rabport (on Siha McComit on February 5) also saw a non -Zionist perspective, that it is more accurate to say that the displacement project reflects the deepest currents in Jewish society. No one was surprised that the fascist religious oath dealt with the press conference held by the Abi House, as it was divine, but it was not expected - and it may have been completely expected in a look back - Bani Gantz said that Trump's displacement plan represents ""creative, original and interesting"", and that Yair Labid says that the press conference in which the plan was presented was ""Good for Israel"", and that Yair Golan, ""the leader of the Zionist left"", is satisfied with saying that the plan is not practical, as if all the politicians of the Zionist parties were waiting for the moment when this transformation occurred and the plan would be under the seal of ""Made in America"" ??to adopt it.
It is possible that it is possible that the position and the responses of the parties in the middle and the Zionist left on Trump's proposal to displace the Palestinians are not strange and do not reflect a shift in the positions of those parties, and they were not formed only after the events of October 7, 2023, but rather reflect the lined convictions For those parties, and that they really support these projects. In the past, these parties rejected the displacement projects, not because they conflict with these ideas in principle, but rather because they believe that they are unrealistic and impossible suggestions and may be harmful to Israel's interests. These convictions have changed and the displacement projects have become more legitimate, and do not lead to political punishment for those who adopt these projects from outside the right -wing and right -wing parties after the seventh of October 2023, as a result of the Israeli desire to take revenge on the Palestinian people in general, especially the residents of the Gaza Strip, including the center parties - The right and the Zionist left parties. These parties are adopting more hostile attitudes towards the Palestinian people in general and the inhabitants of Gaza in particular, and are subject to the right -wing populist atmosphere dominant in Israeli society.
The displacement of the people of Gaza to Sinai: a new old Israeli plan",UK
"More than 90 American and international organizations signed a statement condemning the statements of President Princeonald Trump, in which he revealed his intention to displace the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and the United States seized it, and considered that these statements represent an explicit invitation to ethnic cleansing, which is a violation of international law.
The statement pointed out that Trump's statements constitute a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which stipulates in Article 49 of which as ""individual or collective algebraic transportation, as well as deportation, for persons protected from the occupied lands to the lands of the occupied force or to the lands of any other country, whether it is occupied Or not, regardless of his motives, ""noting that its implementation is an ethnic cleansing. The signed organizations, among them: the Council of American Islamic Relations (CAIR), confirmed doctors against genocide, the Progressive Democratic Alliance, Jews for Peace, Churches for Peace, Doctors against Genocide, the families of September 11 for a peaceful tomorrow and the Rights Forum, their rejection Citizen for any attempts to impose forced displacement on the Palestinians.
The statement also stressed that the Gaza Strip, which is inhabited by millions of Palestinians, is facing catastrophic humanitarian conditions As a result of the continuous bombardment and the siege imposed for years, calling on the international community to take a firm position against any attempts to re -draw the demographic map of the region by force. The statement said: ""We are the organizations signed below, denouncing and opposing any effort or initiative, and any invitation, for the forced displacement of the Palestinians from Gaza, and we support the statement issued by Egypt, Jordan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the League of Arab States, which categorically rejected these steps. "".
The organizations emphasized that the United States has no right to impose its decisions on the Palestinian people in Gaza and force other countries to participate in their displacement, noting that ""any temporary displacement that the Israeli occupation may use to impose a permanent denial."" She added: ""While we agree that the urgent humanitarian needs of the people of Gaza may be difficult to meet due to the almost complete damage that Israel caused, we confirm that if it is not possible to provide the necessary services inside Gaza, its residents must be able to reach them within the historical borders of Palestine, and it must be guaranteed. Their right to return. ""
Trump: My plan on Gaza does not include the right to return to the Palestinians

The organizations concluded their statement by saying that ""Palestine is the land of the Palestinian people, and participating in their displacement, facilitation, or support represents a violation of every principle of international law, and undermines the international system based on laws, destroys the reputation of the United States globally, and is really immoral."" This statement comes amid a wave of sharp international criticism of Trump's statements, as the United Nations, Arab countries, European countries, and human rights organizations expressed their rejection of such calls, warning against the catastrophic repercussions of any practical steps in this direction.",UK
"Two Arab summits on one week away; Miniature in Riyadh and Uradah in Cairo. In it, the Arab initiative for Gaza and the post -war will be cooked, while the second one is expected to be approved on the ""Arab alternative to Trump's plan"", and to give it the legitimacy of the Arab consensus.
We are not one of the reliable ""antidote"" of the peaks and joint Arab action, nor we are those who are eagerly awaiting, the facts of the final press conference devoted to declaring decisions and results.

Some of them were expressed in order to consider the Trump plan, and after other countries were satisfied with issuing verbal situations, As a matter of ""unnecessary what is necessary"".
However, we do not know yet, the full details of the Arab counter -initiative, which Trump has been prepared that he would receive it in the coming of the Arab-American summits ... even though its essence can be reduced with one phrase: the reconstruction of Gaza without the displacement of its people, its original owners and refugees to it after the first catastrophe.
In this sense, we look comfortably for the Arab position, as the last thing that the invaders in particular and the Palestinians in general need is a ""new catastrophe"", and the Nakba as the Palestinians redefined it, not only in the loss of the land, but in the displacement of its owners mainly.
The basic principle is that the Arabs do not need to launch a new initiative, as the elements of the solution to the Gaza crisis in its broader and most comprehensive context, available for a long time, and the root of the Arab failure in translating this solution and transferring it into effect, but lies in the reluctance of the Arab system from using the pressure and strengths it has in its possession . Knowledge of the solution and its methods is available, but the ""deficiency"" is the gathering will to move it into effect. Will this time be available?
He comes to you, ""Tawakh"", and he says: Trump makes an offer, and it is natural that you will respond to it with an offer ... Well the American President did, he made an offer to ""a war crime.""
Forced displacement with all the laws and positive and heavenly norms is a war crime .. Is it required of the Arabs to enter In the tender, and start the journey of searching for ""participants"", to soften the ""crime"" on the basis of God, I do not ask you to return the judiciary, but kindness in it?
Whatever it is, we affect the view of the ""Half of the Mother Cup"", which is ""reconstruction without displacement"", and we will leave looking at the empty half, when the Arab plan goes out to the public, and we know where you will meet with Trump and where you will separate from it, and we know how to respond It has Trump on the counter -offer, so there is no ""deal"" that is being completed, with one offer, another display, but rather a series of Mutual offers, in which the strongest party tests its ability to ""reduce the price"", so who will be the strongest party in this game?
In my opinion, and not in sin, the equation of ""Emaar without displacement"" reflects only half of the cup full of the Arab response, but the empty half of it may summarize the following phrase: No Emaar with the presence of Hamas, and in general resistance. This is the point of starting negotiation, or some of us may think so, and this is the ""tax"" that must be paid in advance, ""opening a meter"", to enter the bazaar and bargaining bazaar according to the rules of ""The Art of the Deal"".
We say that, and in the background a fact once: no one wants to attribute the resistance as well, or A confesses, or given by ""Prestige"" relief, accommodation and reconstruction, are given to you, so the weapons of the warm war in their new chapter will be given to you, and they will not give up on it without a large price.
We say that, and in the background as well, and Trump's feast with ""hell"" for Hamas and Gaza, the instinct of revenge and revenge that directs the Israeli decision and its formation .. We say that and in the background as well, the specter of the human catastrophe that took place on the people of Gaza, and the sword of displacement that was worshiped on the necks of its people.
In his description of Trump's displacement plan, Thomas Friedman saw it as a plan from outside the mind, not from outside the box. This is completely true, that we are the Arabs, we do not need this time to think from outside the box, but rather from it, and inside the box says the following:
The official Arabs must exert the maximum pressure on the authority, the organization and the presidency, to legislate its doors to share the ""Palestinian All"" and build a unified leadership reference for the Palestinian people, all the Palestinian people.
I almost assure that if they do so, they will find a great response, and perhaps unconditional, from the forces of the resistance and their factions. But the Lord of a liquid asks here: Does the officials want,- most of them at least- such as this? And whoever strengthens the Ramallah team, and he closed all doors Dialogue, reconciliation, and unity, does it not strengthen the intransigence of Arab capitals in support of his intransigent positions in the first place?
We do not need all this controversy over the ""next day"", and with our hands- Palestinians and Arabs- to close this door in the face of the most ugliest and most dangerous scenarios, and if there is a need to throw the blame on anyone, the blame here is the Palestinian leadership first, because it turned the back of the calls of unity and harmony And the Arab countries are the following, because they did not employ their great weight to overcome the intransigence of Ramallah, but rather in contrast to that, as it worked Some of them are encouraging and connected.
Hamas said, and she stated and shouted, that it is not about to resume the rule of Gaza, but in return, it stresses that Gaza will not rule without it, so what about you and some think about the rule and administration of Gaza, the body of Hamas and the ruins of the resistance. This is a recipe for ruin, and in preparation for new rounds of war and confrontation.
You can ask the Palestinian party, who has stood up and resisted for fifteen months, and made a flood of martyrs and sacrifices, to show a higher amount of flexibility, and make more unwanted concessions, at least to raise Affairs and trials about the people of Gaza. However, you cannot, without gambling to deepen the wound and prolong the recovery.
In any case, and from the entrance to ""Baghghamati"", my work is pure, we advise the two peaks, in Riyadh and Cairo, to search for solutions that have feet that they will walk, so that they do not remain a seat, unable to advance a step forward, as it was the case of many Arab initiatives, and to build On the ""flexibility of the resistance"", which was accepted by a government of reconciliation from outside the factions, and accepted the ""societal support"" as included in the Egyptian initiative, And they do not think for one moment in harmony with what the populist right wants in the White House, and the fascist right in ""Al -Kira"".
We count on Cairo's private understanding of the Gaza and the Gaza and the entire Palestinian scene. We count on the conviction of Egypt, that opening the door to embarrassment and directing projects will be reflected in the security of Gaza, Sinai and Egypt in general.
We count on Cairo's awareness in the difficult way; Hamas in Gaza is a valve of Egyptian national security, even as it is a threat to Israeli security. Egypt's security is not from the security of Israel, but rather that the most dangerous threat to Egyptian national security is that inherent in the ""Israeli security theory"", which means that the people of Gaza, and its resistance, are a defensive line ahead of the security of Sinai, Suez and the valley.
We relied on the ""shock"" that the White House master created, for the accounts of other Arab countries neighboring and its sensitivities .. We count on the fact that the issue today, it has deviated from the idea of ??solidarity and support for the Palestinians, on the deceptive and black pale Wazan Arab, so does the Arabs move at the end of the summit of Riyadh and Cairo, to the location of the perpetrator after they remained? For many years at the location of the object?

"The role of the Palestinian people during 77 years of the calamity of Palestine is highlighted in its advanced and advanced role in addressing many and various attempts, whether in its source or its content, aimed at removing its cause and ending the conflict on the basis of jumping on its rights, including projects of displacement, the alternative homeland and resettlement and the abolition of the right to return.
The issue would not have remained alive and strongly and to top the global political scene continuously, had it not been for the concerted and intersection (at the same time) vital factors, including what is a Palestinian self -effort, and throughout that comes the solidarity action supporting Palestinian rights at the Arab national level, as well as Islamic and international space , At the two levels; Official and popular without exception.
There, on the opposite party, a dominant conspiracy effort that sought to support and support the project of the occupying state and maintain its cohesion, and that effort also contributed to strengthening its aggression. And in keeping the vocabulary of the case in its first letters in place and continuous.
We see that the most important of all of these factors is the Palestinian struggle march, the absolute Palestinian people rejected to abandon their rights, resist in all forms liquidation projects, and his serious and hard work to restore their sweet land, and to impose their rhythm on the public scene For the case.
It was what characterized the march of the Palestinian struggle, the exchange of resisting performance between the masses of the people, as it was his presence, distraction and distribution between home and abroad, and he turned the ordeal of displacement into a real grant.
History recorded the launch of the organized liberation act after the Nakba by establishing the Palestine Liberation Organization in the arms of the Palestinian diaspora, and what it provided from all forms of resistance, and the resulting framing of the Palestinian liberation action in both national crucible.
Then the effective and distinctive resistor act moved to the Palestinian interior and was most prominent, so he penetrated the global space, and began to present the issue in another way, and here we are talking about the uprising of the stones and Al -Aqsa, and the heroic action of the Palestinian people in Gaza and their steadfastness in front of five wars, and a brutal aggression launched by the occupying state, the last of which is and still is still Conducting aggression, genocide, and ethnic disinfection for 15 continuous months.
In the same context, it comes to the resisting act of the West Bank and Jerusalem, and the Palestinian people are rooted and their standing in the face of settlements and settlers, and the role is completed by what the Palestinian people presented within the lands of 1948, and what can complete the contract of the unity of the land, the people and the fate.
And we put what he tries The US -returning US President Trump from the call for the displacement of the Palestinian people in Gaza in the same historical and political context, to try a Western political figure, which is effective again in the displacement of the people, strengthening the occupation project, and giving him more legitimacy, in violation of international laws and norms, and all possible To be a logic in politics, paths of conflicts, and their endlessness.
Despite what might be a real danger from the repercussions of the Trump project, especially on the people of Gaza, who paid and are still a very expensive price in front of the military, killing, destruction, disinfection, and displacement machine, we see that the American president gave an opportunity that may be unique to the Palestinian issue and its people and its service, both in absurdity The content in its transcendence of the will of the Palestinian people, and not to give them consideration of the minimum limits of humanitarian dealing, as well as the effect Directly for the displacement project, which is essentially structurally organic in organic organism over countries, especially Egypt and Jordan, and served the case at the timing of the project's submission, and gave an additional force factor to defend the Palestinian right to prevent the displacement.
The only Palestinian people concerned with confronting President Trump's policy are no longer, but almost Countries on the expansion of the global geographical map are targeted and concerned with standing in the face of American policy and stopping their arbitrary measures, especially since what threatens it from the weight of the national danger that affects the nerve of life in the countries, and this exceeded the imposition of sanctions on international institutions such as the International Court of Justice, and what indicates something unity The global position against Trump's policies- especially the displacement project- the position of German Chancellor Schultz, who described the Trump project as A terrible scandal.
Perhaps this description of accuracy is a place, as Trump's policy strikes American projects itself for peace in the Middle East in its first session, such as the normalization of the occupation state with the Arab countries and Abraham agreements, especially since the project of displacement from an angle and refusing to establish the state from another angle makes the opportunities of my goal Peace projects in the wind.
Then the timing factor emerges, as the Palestinian issue leads the global scene for more than a year and a half, and it has achieved strategic gains in crystallizing a global awareness of the Palestinian darkness, and that the superiority of the Palestinian right to the narrative of the Israeli falsehood has become clear, and the world no longer fools lies, and has continued what He fell from crimes in Gaza, and turned With his crossing effort to the borders of countries and continents across the world, to a sustainable solidarity act.
What the occupying state in Gaza did for 15 months is still present in front of us, so the most fantasy did not imagine the occurrence of methodological killings and destruction of this size, and in full view of the world, as happened by the Israeli war machine and the occupation soldiers against the Palestinian people in Gaza.
Here, the main, pivotal and vital role of the Palestinian people highlights the leadership, factions and sectors of popularity - as institutions or crowds as individuals - to lead the scene in confronting the displacement scheme, especially as it is the first target of the project, with no reduction in the maximum and strategic importance of Arab countries, especially Egypt, Jordan, and countries The same weight, led by Saudi Arabia, as well as the situation of Islamic countries as Turkey.
What gives an eagerness to all these factors rejecting the displacement project is the strength of the Palestinian position. The importance and duty of every segment of the Palestinian people to play its role in confronting, as it is found at home and abroad, and here we point out that the people of Gaza have played their role and an increase in defending the menstruation of the case. The role increases his need for those who have the space of capabilities And permeability, and the meaning here is the Palestinians of the outside, who are spread around the world in more than 100 countries and in the six continents of the world, so that their role is similar to the roots of the Palestinians of the interior in Palestine, and even their resistance to the occupation and its plans face to face.
The Palestinians of the outside were placed in the role of the supporter within the global movement, and throughout the aggression period on the Gaza Strip, and their action was varied and distinct, but with the increase in the danger that they have rights and aims to delete it, this requires organized and coordinated plans and strategies, in order for the Palestinian people to hear their voice.
Perhaps what is required is now a two -way action; Firstly, the steadfastness of the people of Gaza in the face of the plan, and that they feel that they were not left for their destiny, especially from their brothers, brothers and their skin around the world, and they are the crushed people who are crushed after all this destruction.
Here we offer the initiative of twinning and direct brotherhood between the Palestinian families abroad and all the families of Gaza in a sustainable way, and this is coordinated with the relevant official authorities in Gaza, and the idea is not to leave a family in Gaza without support, and acquaintance and solidarity will be direct, and without a mediator, as one depends on his brother and family with a relative of blood And that is sustainable. This comprehensive relief guarantees relief support Urgent and psychological and moral support.
It comes with this and with the same level of seriousness, the political, popular, media and legal action by communicating with local decision makers and in all forms that the laws allow, and that the message reach them clear that the Palestinian people were absolutely rejecting any attempts to undermine the rights.
It is the required action, the incubating conferences that express the rejection of these projects, especially by institutions across the world that have been organized in their framing work for the Palestinian people during the past decades, whether in the Americas, Europe, or transit or not crossing, such as the popular conference of Palestinians abroad. And the factor of time and the speed of action is important in this context.
It is important for the Palestinian popular institutions to revive the Arab and international popular forces, and to urge them to carry out aspects of rejecting displacement projects, within what is permitted by local and international laws.
And we conclude by saying in our reading of the Palestinian scene, and despite the dangers that occur, and the pain that the Palestinian people suffer in in Gaza, the West Bank, and many places. The Palestinians to their homes and cities from which they were displaced in 1948.

Trump's inauguration of the opinions and analyzes of Arab and international newspapers, which tried to anticipate the future of the region under the new American administration. Also, it was not lost to talk about the ""violence"" committed by settlers in recent days in the West Bank, the relationship of Trump's return to power and the decisions of Israeli officials to ""increase these actions."" The conversation is present about the dialectic of the establishment of the State of Israel, and the importance of ""accepting reality in order to reach peace and the two -state solution.""
We start presenting newspapers for this day from the Haaretz newspaper, which wrote an editorial entitled: ""Israel and Trump gave the green light to the settlers' terrorism.""
The editorial is discussing decisions and statements recently issued by Trump and Israeli officials, and the newspaper believes that it ""encourages violence"" by settlers in the West Bank.
The newspaper begins the article by referring to the condemnation of the Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz to ""violence and attacks against the Palestinians"", against the backdrop of violence that erupted in the village of ""Al Hotel"" in the northern West Bank.
The newspaper questions the seriousness of this condemnation, and believes that the Israeli minister ""granted the green light to the violence of settlers"", when he announced the end of the issue Arrest orders against settlers without trial orders.
End proposed stories
In this context, the newspaper cites an accident that occurred during the ""violence"" carried out by settlers in the hotel village, when an Israeli policeman opened fire and wounded two settlers seriously, and indicates the testimony of the policeman who was investigating, when he said that some settlers were holding stones at their hands and began throwing it towards Police officers.
The newspaper also cited statements of a security source, in which he said that the police officer may have shot because he believed that the masked settlers were in fact Palestinian ""terrorists"".

It is worth the end
The newspaper says that the simplest way to reconcile these two versions of the events is to admit that they are not contradictory. There are also ""Jewish terrorists.""
Haaretz adds that Minister Katz made a great contribution to drawing the similarities between ""Jewish and Arab terrorists"", when he decided ""and because of the expected release of Palestinian terrorists"" within the exchange deal, to add ""his own attachment to the hostage deal to cancel the detention without trial to the currently detained settlers"" on The background of violence.
For Trump, the newspaper believes that he ""in turn encouraged settlers' violence, when he decided to lift the sanctions imposed by the Biden administration on settlers involved in violence against the Palestinians in the West Bank.""
Haaretz says that hope is concluded that the Trump administration will soon realize that ""if it wants to enhance the peace in the world, and the Middle East, the settlement project is a serious obstacle to that.""
The newspaper concludes by saying that the hotel village incident is ""a glimpse of what can happen under a reckless defense minister and a prime minister who considers the preservation of the government coalition everything for him."" The only hope is for the Israeli army to make everything in his power to curb ""these Jewish terrorist cells,"" according to the newspaper.

In the Times newspaper, we read an article by Daniel Venkelstein, under the title: ""The key to peace in the Middle East is the acceptance of the past.""
The writer begins his article by talking about the story of his family, which immigrated from the city of Lviv, western Ukraine during World War II, and says: ""His grandfather built a house in the city - which was part of Poland at that time - before the start of World War II, But the Soviet Union confiscated the house and all its grandfather's property, then its ownership moved to Ukraine, before it was sold to its current owner.
Venkelstein believes that the legitimacy of what happened to his grandfather's house was ""largely doubtful, even under the Soviet law"", and that he has the right to think about it as ""theft"", and he adds: ""I will be very dissatisfied because of that, and I may expect reasonably Others share my resurrection. ""
But the writer says that ""he will not expect that if he began to go out with a march across the streets of London to demand a return to his home in Lviv, he would turn and find people follow him in the march.""
He adds that Fif was a multi -ethnic city, shared by the ""Jews, Poles and Ukrainians"", and after the end of the war, Fif became part of Ukraine, and the Polish left it, and almost no longer any Jew.
Venkelstein believes that it is ridiculous to ""demand the re -drawing of the borders of states, and the abolition of 85 years of ownership bases in Lviv, so that people are allowed to return to the property of their ancestors.""
The writer says that he narrated the story of his family at the beginning of the article because of its ""clear connection to the Middle East"", where a controversy has prevailed for a century about the establishment of the State of Israel, some - in the opinion of the writer - He believes that its creation was merely a ""pure invasion and theft"", and some ""sympathizes with the return of the oppressed Jewish refugees to their ancient homeland, and they see that this could have been done without violence, if it was accepted from the beginning.""
The writer notes that ""about half of the Jews of the world live in Israel, and they have established a state there,"" which is a state ""offered by the United Nations, and the great powers recognized"", and this state ""will not go anywhere, and there will remain a continuous war until this is accepted. The simple truth, ""as he put it.
Venkelstein says he strongly believes in the Palestinian state, and that the transformation of influential forces in Israeli politics against this idea is a ""deep moral and strategic mistake"", but he ""understands why that situation has become a prevailing, as the Israeli people cannot accept a country to its vicinity threatening it with violence, and preparing it with extermination.""
The writer describes the campaigns in solidarity with the Palestinians in the West, as it carries with it ""its own agendas"", and that it ""uses the Palestinians as a supportive speech"", and misleads the Palestinians who ""claim their support.""
The writer offers a sarcastic approach in this context, and he believes that these campaigns are similar to a friend ""advises him to give up his life, take up arms, and go to invade a city Fif himself. ""
The writer concludes by saying that it is the duty of supporters for Israel to insist on the need to allow the Palestinians to enjoy dignity in their state, but that insistence ""will go in vain if the Palestinians are not equally urged of firmness to accept living in peace with their Jewish neighbors."" This means - in the opinion of Venkelstein - to provide financial compensation and ""not the right of return, the impossible practically"", and peace will not be achieved until ""everyone reconciles with history and reality.""

In Al -Sharq Al -Awsat newspaper, we read to the writer Abdullah Al -Rabah, in which he presents his perceptions of the situation in the region in light of Trump's return to the presidency of the United States of America.
The writer says that Trump and the Republican Party achieved ""a tripartite victory that authorizes them to control the presidency, the Senate and the House of Representatives."" This victory constitutes a ""opportunity for Trump and his team to implement what he promised without harassment of their competitors"", but it also constitutes ""a challenge to them to build a strong era that restores the United States its prestige, which lost part of it with the weak administration of the country in the last period"", and the author means the management of the atmosphere Biden.
Al -Rabah sees that Biden left the White House and his covenant. Several descriptions, ""represented internally with"" inflation, wasting resources in the deployment of the liberal left -wing left and California fires "", while"" at the external level, this is represented by the Ukraine War, and the Israel War Gaza, which continued without Washington's ability to achieve an overwhelming victory for its allies And not to stop wars. ""
The writer believes that Trump should not be seen as the Savior, as ""his previous history does not put him among the distinguished presidents like Lincoln, Roosevelt, Kennedy, or even Reagan"", and Trump ""faces more challenges and much greater than the challenges he faced in a period His first presidency. ""
The writer reviews a number of issues and variables in the Middle East, facing Trump, saying that the ceasefire in Gaza and the exchange of prisoners ""happened exactly as Trump promised before his inauguration"", and that the fall of Bashar al -Assad in the period between Trump's election and his inauguration, means reassessing American policy Towards Damascus, which ""will not be evident before next summer.""
The writer believes that the Trump administration is in a more powerful position than it was in its first period when it faced Iran in terms of nuclear file. “Iran 2025 is not Iran 2017. With the fall of Assad, and undermining Hezbollah's strength, Iran's nails have been greatly released. ”Therefore, the most prominent points in Trump's agenda regarding Iran are summarized by“ the nuclear file, the missile system, and influence in Iraq. ”
As for Israel, the writer believes that Trump ""aspires to be the maker of the agreement between it and Saudi Arabia, whose position is not changed to the two -state solution.""",UK
"At a time when Cairo is preparing to host the emergency Arab summit on February 27, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdel -Ati began a visit yesterday, Sunday, to Washington, for a plan for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip during the establishment of an Arab coalition, according to the sources of ""Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed "". This visit comes before the emergency Arab summit with the aim of discussing the dangerous developments of the Palestinian issue, especially in light of the statements of US President Donald Trump regarding the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, which observers believe is a historical test of the Arab countries to confront the existential threat that threatens not only the Palestinians and their cause, but Also the surrounding Arab countries.

Ayman Salama: Forced displacement is a war crime
The emergency Arab summit
A statement by the Egyptian Foreign Ministry stated that the emergency Arab summit scheduled for February 27th comes in coordination with Bahrain, the current president of the Arab summit, and the General Secretariat of the League of Arab States, and in consultation with the Arab countries, including the State of Palestine, which requested the holding of this summit. Observers considered that despite the many challenges that The Arab League faces it, but it has the ability to face plans to displace Palestinians by adopting multiple strategies. Among these strategies, the intensification of relief aid and the reconstruction of Gaza, which enhances the steadfastness of the Palestinians on their soil and fails the displacement plans.
Moreover, the Arab League can enhance cooperation with the international community to exert diplomatic pressure on the American administration and Israel to stop any attempts to displace the Palestinians. It can also resort to international bodies, such as the Security Council and the United Nations, to consider any forced displacement as an ethnic cleansing and violation of international law. The Arab League can also study the activation of the joint defense agreement to protect the rights of the Palestinian people, and to send a clear message that the Arab countries are ready to take practical steps to protect the Palestinians.
Special Arab summit in Cairo to discuss facing Trump's plan to displace the people of Gaza
Given the supportive positions of the Palestinian rights by some countries, such as Türkiye, Iran and South Africa, an invitation to these countries can be invited to participate in the efforts of the reconstruction of Gaza. This international cooperation would enhance the effectiveness of the reconstruction process It sends a strong solidarity message with the Palestinian people. Diplomats and experts emphasized that the participants in the emergency Arab summit can take a firm position to reject any attempts to displace the Palestinians from Gaza, whether permanently or temporarily, and considering this a kind of ethnic cleansing. It can also address the international bodies, such as the Security Council and the United Nations, to inform them of the Arab decision rejecting these attempts, and to call for international measures to prevent their implementation.
In this context, the professor of international law Ayman Salama confirmed, in statements to ""Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed"", that the right of the Palestinian people to self -determination is one of the basic principles in international law, and it is an inaccurate right to act or fall aspiring, as confirmed by United Nations resolutions, Including Resolution No. 3236 issued by the United Nations General Assembly in 1974, which recognizes the right of the Palestinians to self -determination and establish their independent state. Salama added that any attempts to impose forced resettlement on the Palestinians outside their historical land represents a flagrant violation of this right, and constitutes an international crime aimed at liquidating the Palestinian issue and undermining the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people. He also indicated that the article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 prohibits the forced displacement of the population under any circumstance, which means that any attempt to impose the resettlement of the Palestinians in any other country, including Saudi Arabia, contradicts these binding rules for international humanitarian law.
The Arab League can study the activation of the joint defense agreement to protect the Palestinians

Forced displacement is a war crime
Salama pointed out that the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court defines forced displacement as a war crime and a crime against humanity, which means that any plan aims to force the Palestinians to leave their historical lands under the cover of ""resettlement"" falls within the scope of international crimes that require accountability and accountability before international courts . Salama stressed that the Arab and Islamic position was evident through the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, as the Arab and Islamic countries rejected any projects aimed at filtering the Palestinian issue or imposing forced solutions that ignore the historical and political rights of the Palestinian people. He stressed that the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative clearly stipulated that the solution The fair to the Palestinian issue must be in accordance with international legitimacy decisions, and not through imposed solutions that detract from the rights of Palestinians and the sovereignty of Arab countries. As for the recent statements of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding the settlement of the Palestinians, he considered it Salama not merely a political provocation, but rather reflects a colonial mentality that tries to impose new facts on the ground by force, in a flagrant challenge to international will and the laws regulating relations between states. However, such attempts will remain rejected by all countries that believe in justice and truth, which have repeatedly emphasized their steadfast support for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.

"A few days, and hundreds of Palestinian national figures are collapsed to meet in Doha, under the umbrella of the ""Palestinian National Congress"" as ""a continuous and continuous popular movement from inside and outside the country"", ultimately aims to rebuild the Palestine Liberation Organization, as an inclusive unitary framework under a unified national leadership It addresses the tasks of the exceptional stage experienced by the people of Palestine, its national cause and its legitimate resistance.
It can be said, that the ""National Congress"" came as a culmination of several initiatives that started after October 7, from inside and outside the occupied Palestinian homeland, aimed at its entirety to resurrection and revival, and sometimes it was said ""recovery"" of the PLO, building a national reference for the Palestinian people ( The idea of ??inviting the unified leadership framework for the convening), and providing a safety network for resistance and the national project, is transcended to confront the war of cordon. Purification, genocide, annexation projects, speed, Judaization, racist separation and displacement, in Gaza first, in the West Bank, Jerusalem, and the whole of the occupied Palestinian territories in the last place.
In the background of all these initiatives, the conviction of a deep assembly lies in the fact that the PLO and the Palestinian Authority did not play their role. The natural and hoped that one of the most heinous chapters of the Zionist -imperialist war against the people, their cause, their resistance, their rights and their project, that this consensus did not prevent the variation of estimates and descriptions of the behavior of the ""official Palestinian institution"" and its performance, who said that ""deficit and negligence"" said to someone who says ""collusion"", Sometimes, the ""ribs"" in the plan to put out the resistance of the Palestinian people, in the West Bank Western as in the Gaza Strip.
This is understandable and natural, given the multiplicity of stripes and initiatives, and the difference in their political and intellectual references, as well as the variation of the political and security contexts that they work between their backs, and the accounts and connections dictated, concerns, concerns, bets and hopes.
And the variation in the backgrounds of these initiatives and their motives, led and will lead to a variation in ""bets and ceilings of expectations"", and even to create ""tensions"" about the options of the future, and any response to the critical and historical Palestinian moment with its requirements and their levels ... which puts the conference and the conference at an important crossroad Their first meeting, as three options await them, each of them will decide, The fate of this initiative, the limits of its action and its impact, and whether it will gain tactical importance - or is it a sustainable strategic impact on the overall Palestinian situation:
The shift to the ""Lobby"" pressure group, completing what was started by other pressure groups, has already grew and multiplied on the stem of the long and bitter Palestinian division, noting that the ""group"" this time, heavier weight and more, and weighs a presence, and there are national, regional and international conditions surrounding With her work, she gives her a higher ability to influence.
Thinking in this way, is completely legitimate, in which there is no objection or dust on it, and it dictates the group, choosing the tools and methods of its work that is consistent with its function, and it resorted to maximizing the idea of ??""dialogue"" and ""attempts to persuade"" the feasibility of reform, resurrection and revival, but it is The ""soft"" pressure methods do not fall in the context of its performance of its mission and its delegation that she chose for itself, and there is a need to answer Question: How can dialogue and soft pressure, lead to the change that appeared and appears to be disobedient to all initiatives and initiatives, from within the Palestinian body, and from Arab and international parties?
Many sons and daughters of the people of Palestine, and after two decades of appeals and ""pressure"" to restore unity, and four decades of initiatives aimed at ""Organization Reform Editing "", has become less confident and seriously confident this path, as the political division, which deepened institutional division, was reinforced by the geography of Gaza from the West Bank, made and made it difficult to bridge the gap and fill the gaps, which came the earthquake of October 7 to deepen it instead of burying it, Especially after the flood went away in drawing breaks and boundaries between the ends: Hamas reached an unprecedented peak In her resistance project, and the authority fell unprecedented gendarmes, in its consistency with its approach, and its consistency with the outputs of the Israeli solution, its requirements and its obligations, before the political.
Suppose that the requirements of the after -ceasefire, or after the silence of the defender in Gaza, may dictate a form of ""pleasure marriage"" between the two teams, but the failure of all multi -resource efforts, aimed at restoring reconciliation and recovering the unit, indicates that this road has become closed, And that the efforts made to open it have become a form of tampering, and that spending it in other aspects, may return with greater benefit to the people, their cause and struggle.
This is a case that needs to be thinking and management, not only by the conference and the conferences. They are only one segment, from the Palestinian people, but by the Palestinians and their friends. all.
Reducing the fate and seals of the work of this group of Palestine men and its women, to a tool for the production of ""authority/ organization"", by entering some formal reforms on its structure and performance, of the type of guarantee of a symbolic participation of this or that faction (from the organization's factions or those outside it), or modification Conditions for this current/ team is one of the currents that make up power and openness and the organization.
Although a bet like this, it involves a kind of ""risk"" if it is permissible to speak, it is possible, especially since the Palestinian experience, which is full of seasons of the scars and quotas, has kept many in the official Palestinian circle, even though their presence in the popular circle is almost ""a cubic zero "".
Here it is worth noting that the challenges that await the Palestinian people, their cause and their project are much greater than these narrow and closed accounts, and the conference that must be a major national crane, for a state of renaissance and revival, it does not have to land as it is just a negotiating tool to improve the location of this party or That, it should not be allowed to convert it into a way to ""improve the conditions of some negotiating"" with the influential leadership of the PLO
Such an approach, and to a large extent, the first approach, shakes hands And the feet of the conference and the conferences, and prevent them from fighting the serious crowding of the official leadership, on every site and inch, in the homeland and abroad, that in the battle to win public opinion, or in the conflict over the structures and infrastructure of the PLO, from popular organizations and federations, and will prolong the age of division instead of that It is shortened, and you will put the future of the Palestinian people, in the hands of leadership, which is certain of many Palestinians, that it is no longer a trusted On their representation and pronouncement in their name, they do not give them their confidence, in terms of successive surveys, and the resort to the same leadership to disrupt the general elections for their fear, which can overflow the ballot boxes, and always with arguments and excuses, apparent in it mercy and its innerness in it.
The truth is that the warning against this road/cucumber seems very necessary, and working in its early beginnings, to ensure a founding step in harmony with the national need to create a Palestinian national leadership completely expressive of the aspirations of its people and its longings, and also expressing the collective conscience of the initiatives and initiatives who will come to a portion of them, To Doha under the tent of the ""Palestinian National Congress"".
The fact that those who think (or may think) with this mentality may not constitute a majority of The attendees do not eliminate the urgent need to alert the risk of slippage to a well -known road.
It is the most difficult of all other options, for the conference and the conference to address the task of splitting a new path in front of a renewed Palestinian national movement, capable of its people, to enter the thresholds of a new strategic stage .. Here the discussion can open to two titles:
Here, the Palestinians need a ""third stream"", which can be argued with its importance and necessity, and even its insistence on the one hand, and the ability of this group (conference and conference) to be itself, this is the ""third trend.""
On the other hand, the need is appropriate for this current, but the conference is not in its composition and delegation, it is the ""legal midwife"" that you can extract to the circle of light and life .. You must search elsewhere, with other elements, some of which are among the members And that we call for and look forward to accomplishing.
This option raises questions that have been banned to this day, including; What about the ""only legal actor"", and the accumulated gains represented mainly in Arab and international confessions of the legitimacy and oneness of his representation of the Palestinian people? Is it required to build an alternative or parallel organization? What about the failed experiences and attempts that the Palestinian National Movement has gone through for ten or five years?
These questions are received, in detail and in detail, in the face of any attempt to challenge the leadership of the authority and the organization, even as they are involved in the worst policies and practices that cause the most harmful damage to its people and their cause, and invoke the worst experiences of failure and malice and the abhorrent external interventions, in order to ""break the oxidant"" in the jazz Expression, bypassing the experience of storming the resisting work factions organized Editing, in the year 1969, after the battle of dignity.
At that time, the Palestinians had two titles: Al -Shuqairi, the organization formed from the womb of the Arab official incubator, the leadership of Fatah and the other factions: the first, “official legitimacy without strong popular rules”, and the second “revolutionary legitimacy with a broad popular rule”, until the legitimacy and identification were merged into one body.
Today, with the different national, regional and international contexts, there is a similarity that does not want supporters of ""keeping the old on his foot"" recognition and referring to it: There is ""official legitimacy without popularity"", and I think that the popularity and companions of Al -Shugairi in a timely And there is ""popular resistance, not an adjective A representative official for her, ""The solution of this duality appears today, a dilemma that must be resolved if we want the Palestinian national movement to be renewed and to start towards new spaces.
The Fatah movement and Yasser Arafat did not find great trouble in achieving the marriage between the two legitimacy, for a few years. With its various schools, ""absolute evil"" from the perspective of Arab officials, and Western capitals ... these obstacles, have prevented until now, without Hamas's success in creating a pairing that has already been accomplished at lower costs, and makes its task more difficult.
One of the reasons for the failure of Hamas to create the required pairing, despite the high blood bills that prompted it, specifically in the flood, its failure to adopt a strategy based on ""partnership and participation"" with the rest of the people's components and their national movement, and their inclination as the rest of the national and Islamic work factions, to dominate and exclusively, as a kind Therefore, it was affected by the ""empowerment"" school of the style and upbringing.
Today, after the flood, we assume that the approach has changed, And to change radically, and this is what we heard from the leadership of Hamas, and what we have seen as evidence of it in the experience of the war on Gaza, are sufficient evidence to start the journey of partnership, although it was booby -trapped with doubts and possibilities.
What is required today is more than ever, going without hesitation or slowing down to form a second Palestinian address, and not to leave the ""boycott"" in Ramallah to be the only title for the Palestinian people.
It is required today, from Hamas before others, and more than others, to take the initiative on this path, and to appear already not by saying, that the logic of the partnership is the ruling logic, for the project of a ""united Palestinian national front"", which includes all the resistance factions and currents, including those in it Constant in the interior of Fatah and the Organization, and all Palestinian initiatives, personalities and gatherings in the occupied and besieged homeland and diaspora, all organizations and federations The popularity that is activated or formed, women and youth movements, academics and academies, with a special focus on the generations coming from the sons and daughters of this people.
You must find any party that is forced to visit Ramallah to deal with the Palestinian issue, to find itself compelled- at least at the end of the way- to address The second title, nothing can happen or pass, without his approval of it .. This was the case on the eve of 1969, and thus it must be awaiting the moment with which the organization and the entire Palestinian political system can be recovered.
The world should not rely on the ""pen"" suspended in the pocket of one of them, nor to the ""seal"" left in the stairs of their office, because the Palestinian people are elsewhere, and the tongue of its condition says: This situation remains from the shops, and it can open the gates of hell to the people and its cause, in particular After more than two decades, the experience of accumulated failure, which did not bring useful and did not calm down ... while the Israeli -American monster is surprising, To devour with the remaining land, rights and holy sites, and the specter of displacement hovering in the sky of the West Bank, as well as his ugly head over the people of Gaza and its owners.
This trend and choice dictates the creation of pieces and cutting with two theories, as long as they were promoted, with or without awareness, with a good or bad intent:
I think that the ""Palestinian National Congress"" can play the role of ""Catalyst"", in the creation of this second national title, he himself cannot be, and he is a minor by virtue of its composition, structure and delegating it to become ""the second title"", however it is available attic From the energies, location, and preliminary general consensus, it can work on two parallel and compatible lines:
It is okay for the conference to be a ""pressure group/ lobby"" for reconciliation, dialogue and reform, and it is inappropriate for it to be seen as a gateway to improve the location and roles, amplifying or promoting, but the historical function that must remain in the eyes of the two conferences, and others, is to address the question of leadership, renewal and gravity For the Palestinian National Movement, which qualifies it to carry out its tasks and historical physical responsibilities, now, and in the coming days, are we? Do you do?

"The displacement of a people and the replacement of its last place, or the method of colonial ethnic cleansing, represents the main axis of the Zionist thought and its aides that repeat the slogan ""Palestine is a land without a people, for a people without land.""
The strategic plan was formulated ""A New Strategy for Security The Realm"", in 1996, based on that slogan, and as a path to achieve the dream of Greater Israel. It was prepared by the Israeli Thought Center, the Institute of Advanced Strategic and Political Studies (IASPS), which was founded by Robert Lewinberg 1984 in Washington DC. The participating group included: Richard Perl (former US Defense Secretary), Douglas Vic (former US Defense Minister Undersecretary), David Warmersar (former US Vice President Cheney's adviser), his wife Miral Warmers, and Robert Lynberg and others. All of them are Zionist Jews with American and Israeli nationalities, and they were influential during the administration of former US President Bush and promoted strongly to the concept of the ""new Middle East"".

The plan indicated that the previous Israeli governments responded to the principle of the land for peace, and this is what Putting Israel in the position of retreat. Therefore, she must adopt a new approach based on the principle of peace in exchange for peace, using strength and self -reliance, and to contain and destabilize the stability of countries that pose a threat to their entity. She emphasized that the Arab -Israeli conflict is not permissible in a comprehensive peace with the entire Arab world, and the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state, but by force the Arabs by force to accept everything that Israel seized.
Since 1996, the criminal has worked to implement this plan, taking advantage of Israel's influence and strong impact on directing the American administration, according to its maximum interests. According to it, with the support of the agents of the Zionists abroad and inside the Middle East, Iraq was destroyed and security and stability were destroyed and the regimes were overthrown in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Libya, Sudan, Tunisia and Somalia. .
Based on the basic principles of this strategic plan and imaginary delusions to build the so -called Greater Israel from the river, the Zionists abstained in Israel and America, accepting the peace curriculum. ""By rejecting peaceful coexistence, rejecting the peace initiatives adopted by the Arab countries, and systematically practicing injustice towards the Palestinian people, not to be aware of the right, justice, law and values ??established in the United Nations Charter,"" the Saudi statement said.
Netanyahu's crazy statements recently about the displacement of the Palestinians are consistent with the Zionist plan, and a maneuver to force the Arabs to bear the costs of reconstruction of what Israel destroyed in Gaza. But they should realize - as Professor Rosan McManos reported in her article, ""The Bounds of the Crazy Man theory"" published in the magazine (Foreign Averez) January 24, 2025 - that “studies indicate that it is very difficult to use theory successfully. Indeed, the insanity is rarely rarely raised at the international level. The leaders and heads of contemporary states who try to seem crazy are often failing to persuade their opponents. As for those who succeed, they find that this reputation convinces their opponents that they are not worthy of peace.
Netanyahu and Tremb understand that the world strongly rejects the principle of the ""always strong jungle"", which was used by the colonial powers in the sixteenth century to control, domination and purification The ethnic people, and that international relations are not managed by the mentality of real estate developers. The land of Palestine has lived and lived by Palestinian Muslim citizens, Christians and Jews for thousands of years, and not a land in which the diaspora of the Ashkenazi Jews gathered, or for investment and building towers, resorts, casinos and golf courses on them.
The American administration must understand that if it really wants to maintain the international leadership of its country, it will draw its policies to serve the goals and interests of ""America first"", as it promoted, and not ""Israel first"".
All Palestinian factions must realize the dimensions of the Zionist plans, and their cunning plot to achieve their expansionist goals and ambitions, by uniting their positions and avoiding rivalry between them, and not enabling the haters to gain the Palestinian issue and modify it to the issue of sale and displacement.
Arab and Islamic countries and organizations and the international community must mobilize support for Palestinian steadfastness, and work hard to consolidate the principle of ""Palestine is a land on which a people, not for a people without land,"" in word and deed.

"It does not seem that US President Trump is crazy or a merchant only does not see anything outside the market, as some or many imagine, when the world is surprised by shocking statements about the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza and their resettlement in some Arab countries, then the sector purchased to establish an American investment project and allow Israel to include the West Bank, But everything that President Trump says and adopts does not come out- in my mind- from a rational context that some people, especially the weak, are absolutely crazy. Outside all the limits, it should be avoided and walked and bad, and this is exactly the result and the effect that Trump wants to inflict on the psyche of others and the Arabs specifically depending on a number of facts, including:
1- The power and tyranny of the United States, especially in the face of fragmented Arab entities.
2- The inability and surrender of the Arabs as rulers, elite, and the vast majority of peoples.
3- The dependence of most Arab rulers, if not all of them, on the American guarantee in their continuation, as each of them, exercising influence on a piece of land and a herd of people.
4- The power of Israel derived from American capabilities and tyranny and its constant willingness to play its functional role in the region without any controls, limits or fear of any reaction Arab.
All of these facts give a great deal of credibility to every threat or saying issued by the American president, but the Middle East does not exist in the Arab entities and their rulers only; Rather, there are also regional powers that have their interests and aspirations alongside international powers that have their interests and strategies that crowd American interests and strategy in the Middle East and in other regions of the world, and for this, the unleashing of Israel to launch a continuous war without release and controls creates an unprecedented state of ruin, chaos and humiliation that pays To the emergence of rebellions within the Arab entities and create a favorable environment for extremism in the face of Israeli extremism Out of all limits.
The growth of armed forces and organizations does not concern the resulting resistance from more ruin and destruction and does not fear the loss of authority or influence, and you will inevitably find in the midst of this catastrophic scene from regional and international powers whose interests require that the United States be flooded into a quagmire that drains its strength and does not have a defeat or victory.
There is no doubt that the American president and those around him are aware of the possibility of this bad possibility that the United States can avoid without neglecting its interests and strategy Israel, and for this, President Trump, based on the four facts that we mentioned, which gives his statements a great deal of credibility, is trying to invest this credibility to achieve a number of goals and avoid the occurrence of that possibility by adopting a letter dependent on what is called diplomatic method of shock.
It is to deviate from all the possibilities that take place in the minds of other parties and overcome everything that the other party considered red lines and cannot be thought or approaching, and this would affect the other party, especially if it is weak in amazement and confusion, so the system of priorities that was preparing to negotiate and changes to negotiate About these possibilities and red lines that suddenly fell and overlooked.
But we should not lose sight of the fact that the American president does not play this game with parties that considers herself a shiver like China and Russia; Rather, he practices it with weak and unable Arab parties that are confident in themselves and in each other; Rather, most of them condemn their survival in power to prefer American protection. Political.
Perhaps the American President, by choosing this method, wants to avoid the possibility of the war and achieve a number of goals for the benefit of the United States and Israel, and some of them are in an interest for Arab rulers as well, and we can strive without the guarantee of not making some mistakes in the perception of these goals, the most important of which are:
1- Ensuring and consolidate what Israel has achieved and its emergence as a victor in everyone, a lesson in revenge and hellish punishment, which will remain in the memory of everyone who tries to think or dare to do what Hamas did on October 7, 2023.
2- Putting Hamas, the Palestinians and the Arabs in front of only two options:
The first of them: the destruction of the entire Gaza Strip, the elimination of Hamas, the displacement of those who remain alive from the residents of the Gaza Strip to the Arab countries and the four sides of the Earth, to include the West Bank into Israel after the destruction of parts of it, and the displacement of all those who resist the annexation and the United States’s recognition of this annexation, similar to its recognition of the Golan.
The second of these two options: Homs were directed by its leaders, cadres and fighters from the Gaza Strip and their acceptance in an Arab country, similar to the exit of the Palestine Liberation Organization from Beirut with the difference of circumstances and scenes of the scenario, and in exchange for that the residents of Gaza remain and the Strip is placed. Under an international and Arab joint administration with the Arabs re -reconstruction, while the remaining West Bank after settlements is placed under a Palestinian self -administration that does not have a characteristic of political authority instead of formally annexing it.
3- Accepting Arab countries, especially Saudi Arabia, to normalize without stipulating the two-state solution as a pre-condition.
Trump has counted this project with an invitation to Arab governments to provide an alternative perception and this - apparently - is the director who may be agreed upon to implement the second option, which in terms of achieving all reasonable goals of the United States and Israel and avoids the Arab countries. I triumphed by dropping the first catastrophic option.
Based on this perception, the upcoming Arab summit is expected to issue decisions that refuse to displace the inhabitants of Gaza and undertake the reconstruction of Gaza if Israel adheres to not returning to the war, and in return, the exit of Hamas leaders, cadres and fighters from the Strip to spare their people a catastrophe with which the Hall Nakba 1948 is diminished.
After this summit, the Arab countries will exert campaigns and pressure on Hamas in order to accept the exit from the sector according to how Israel and the United States requires to save some. It can be saved from Gaza and its people, if Hamas accepted that President Trump has achieved one of its most important goals without returning to war and resting Arab political regimes from Hamas headache, and if they refuse, these governments will announce their discharge and evacuation of their responsibility for what the fate of the people of Gaza becomes due to Hamas's intransigence She clung to power and subjected to the Iranian agenda.",LY
"The leader of the ""Ansar Allah"" movement, Abdul -Malik Al -Houthi, stressed that ""the declaration of the criminal US President Donald Trump about his plan to displace the Palestinian people from his land and country is a confiscation of a right that branched out many rights.""
He pointed out that ""Trump has been repeating this thesis and seeking to promote and persuade it and began to exert pressure on some Arab regimes to accept it.""
He said in a television speech carried by the ""Al -Masirah"" channel, that ""the Americans can transfer the Zionist Jews to America and give them a mandate of its states, in which there are vast lands and areas still without residents.""
He added, ""The step of displacement for the people of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank is not a partial step, but rather within the Zionist project that seeks to expand, expand and occupy."" "".
Al -Houthi announced that ""if the American and the Israeli tend to try to implement the plan by force or agree with the Arab regimes to implement it, we will enter even by military power,"" stressing that ""we will enter into missile shelling, enlightenings, marine operations, etc. If the American and Israeli goes to To implement the force of the displacement by force. ""
On Trump's threat to Gaza regarding the release of Israeli prisoners on Saturday, Al -Houthi said: ""Hell for you and your likes of tyrants, unjust, criminals, and arrogant,"" adding, ""Our Mujahideen brothers in Palestine cannot accept that they come out of all the prisoners of the enemy without completing the exchange of the prisoners "".
He explained that ""if the American and the Israeli headed to the escalation, then this means that the region will go to a big problem,"" stressing that ""we will immediately go militarily if the American and the Israeli go based on the threat of the tyrant Trump to the aggression on Saturday or before or after the Gaza Strip."" .
He said: ""We will not hesitate to target the Israeli and American enemy together, and we will watch the course of implementing the agreement.""",PS
"When Donald Trump returned to the presidency of the United States of America in January, Thomas Friedman, a veteran journalist in the New York Times and the prominent orientalist, published an article in which he advised the US President, saying: ""President Trump, you can reshape the Middle East if you dare."" .
Although reshaping the region through punitive imperialist interventions has always been part of American policy in the Middle East, Trump took this challenge to a completely new level.
On Tuesday, he announced that the United States will take control of the Gaza Strip and its possession, while the Israeli aggression has exterminated more than 62,000 Palestinians since October 2023, although the real outcome may be much higher, as most of the sector has turned into ruins .
Regardless of the fact that Trump does not seem aware of even the Gaza site on the map, he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House to officially announce:
""The United States will take control of the Gaza Strip, and we will do a good job in it as well. We will own it.""
According to Trump, this ""long -term position of The monarchy ""will include forced displacement of the largest part of the Palestinian population to"" other countries interested in humanity "", so that Gaza can be converted into"" Rvira Middle East. ""
To remove any doubts about the legitimacy of the United States on land more than 10,000 km away, Trump stressed:
""Everyone who spoke to him loves the idea of ??the United States to have this land, to develop it and create thousands of jobs through a project that will be great.""
However, who said that ethnic cleansing is not a great project?
The threat to the use of military force
In the event that the Palestinians do not agree to this scheme, Trump did not rule out the possibility of deploying American forces to resolve the issue, saying:
""For Gaza, we will do what is necessary. If necessary, we will do it.""
Trump and economic opportunities in Gaza
Of course, it is not surprising that the billionaire and former president of Trump real estate sees in the Gaza Strip a profitable investment opportunity, especially with its distinguished position on the Mediterranean coast, which has suffered widely destroyed by the Israeli army, with the help of former US President Joe Biden.
Will Gaza one day become a site for one of the towers? Trump?
Trump's imperialist strategy goes beyond Gaza
In fact, Trump's repressive approach to Gaza extends to other parts of the world as well. He previously renamed ""the Gulf of Mexico"" to ""the Gulf of America"", threatened to seize the Panama channel, and alluded to the possibility of annexing Canada and Greenland, using military force if necessary.
Are Biden and Democrats better?
Biden and his democratic party are not less brutal, as they continued to support Israel in the extermination of the Palestinians. However, the Trump project to seize Gaza represents an unprecedented level of colonial mania, as it seeks to redraw the map of the Middle East with an individual decision.
Do we live in a new colonial era?
The displacement of the Palestinians from Gaza to make way for the ""Middle East Rvira"" is nothing more than a continuation of the genocide policies. According to the genocide -preventing agreement, any actions aimed at destroying a fully ethnic or religious people or group are considered genocide.
Although the emptying of Gaza from its Palestinian residents is a clear example of this, Trump believes that ""the potential of Gaza is not reasonable"" as long as it is ""the Palestinians no longer to it"", where he stated:
""I don't think People should return to Gaza .. I heard that Gaza was unjust to them. They live as if they are in hell. ""
Is there a solution? Or is the ruin continues?
This hell could have been avoided if he had not been created from the beginning. For decades, the United States funds and supports the Israeli killing machine, as this approach has not changed even as genocide entered a new stage after October 2023.
Now, Trump has returned to reflect the temporary ban that Biden imposed on the delivery of some types of heavy bombs to Israel, which increases the disaster.
American imperialism without solutions
As usual, American imperialism provides a catastrophic solution to problems that contributed to its creation. Trump's scheme is nothing more than an attempt to distract attention from internal crises in the United States, such as the control of corrupt billionaires on the country.
In the end, Trump announced that he wanted to ""clean"" Gaza entirely, a clear fascist discourse that is welcomed by Netanyahu and his allies.
As expected, Trump sees the reinstalization of the Middle East map a step that will bring a ""great stability"" to that region, and perhaps to the whole world.
But we did not expect less than this from the president who describes himself as ""a genius Very stable. ”

"The conversation in political and media circles is renewed about the scenarios of the displacement of population in the Gaza Strip towards Jordanian territory with the escalation of regional tension and the ongoing clashes, and despite the growing conversation and the repetition of direct references to this issue from external parties, the official and popular Jordanian position remained clear and decisive in its rejection of any attempt To impose this scenario on the kingdom, as Jordan considers that passing any plan for collective displacement involves Strategic risks affecting Jordanian sovereignty and national identity, in addition to being a dedication to the occupation and a violation of the fixed rights of the Palestinian people.


Jordan has expressed its repeated rejection of previous localization projects, and in various international forums was keen to find a just and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian issue based on the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and the right to return to refugees, and the Jordanian position rejecting the displacement of the people of Gaza is based on several considerations, most notably that Jordan is carrying over decades Human and economic burdens as a result of hosting large numbers of refugees from neighboring countries, which made the Kingdom's resources and build The infrastructure is in a difficult situation, and any attempt to impose a new resettlement without a comprehensive political solution from It will create an unstable position, and threaten long -term repercussions on the structure of Jordanian society and its national security.

In the face of these renewed pressures, Jordan has political and diplomatic papers that it can wave in defense of its rejectionist position. The Kingdom constitutes an important stability component in the region, and has historical and profound relations with the major countries, in addition to the network of regional and international alliances that realize the importance of the Jordanian role in maintaining balance. Likewise, the international community realizes that any destabilization of Jordanian stability means the escalation of chaos in the region, and this is not what the Europeans and Americans do not want, given the region's sensitivities and the intertwining crises in it, and from here, the security and border coordination that the Kingdom is one of the most important papers, as not Any international entity wants more chaos and chaos on the borders of Israel or in areas close to the areas of burning crisis in the region.


On the other hand, and within the political efforts of His Majesty the King and the delivery of clear and powerful global political messages yesterday, Jordan witnessed a new European support that expressed statements issued by European Union officials, confirming their keenness on the stability and willingness of the Kingdom To provide additional assistance to support its efforts in hosting refugees and economic reform, and although this support is a positive indication of Europe's understanding of the sensitivity of Jordan, it remains dependent on a broader political and economic context, and it is not sufficient to address the roots of Jordan's economic problems and its fears of displacement scenarios, so what Jordan requires At this stage, it is not just financial grants, but rather real political guarantees that maintain the population composition of the Kingdom It prevents the exploitation of the refugee file as a pressure card to liquidate the Palestinian issue.
On the other hand, the American administration's attempts led by Donald Trump, which exerted pressure on Jordan, emerged in the context of what was known as the ""deal of the century"" previously, and the statements about ""Trump's insistence on pressure on Jordan"" are still present and directly present; Where some see it as part of a legacy formed its features of broader pressure policies on the countries of the region, these pressures have sought to impose perceptions to settle the Palestinian -Israeli conflict in isolation from the historical rights of the Palestinians, and without regard to the impact of this on the internal conditions of Jordan or the rest of the region.
It is clear that Jordan will not accept any solutions to be seen as a wrap National and national constants, or the Kingdom's transformation into a ""alternative homeland"" for any other parties, and the Jordanian decision -maker aware that political relations with international powers must be balanced, based on mutual interests and recognition of Jordanian priorities, as Europeans realize, along with some rational American voices, The necessity of Jordan not to deliver in conflicts that do not serve stability in the long run.


Thus, it is confirmed again that the Kingdom, despite its economic challenges and the burden of refugees, has a clear fateful position in rejecting the displacement, and Jordanian diplomacy continues in the international and regional action to deliver a firm message that the solutions of the Palestinian issue must remain confined within the international legal framework in a manner that guarantees the right of the people The Palestinian in the determination of his fate, and although the pressure will not stop, Jordan's steadfastness in this sensitive file He confirms that he is still able to maneuver and defend its constants, no matter how complicated the circumstances appear.",JO

Sir Samour: Trump depends on the maximum bargaining and tends to escalate, but it retreats to diplomacy whenever he faces real resistance to his proposals

US President Donald Trump's retreat from his statements about the Gaza Strip threatening questions about whether this decline means a failure to implement its policies, or that it is just a tactic aimed at achieving gains in favor of Israel.

A book, political analysts, specialists and university professors believe in separate conversations with ""?"", Trump's retreat is not a strategic change. Rather, tactically, and that Trump is still committed to the application of plans that may lead to fundamental changes in the Palestinian scene, noting that the United States may withdraw from the role of the direct mediator in negotiations, allowing Israel freedom to make more influential decisions on the future of the sector.

The writers, analysts, specialists, and university professors confirm that political pressures from the Arab countries and the Palestinian people had a great impact on the amendment of the American position, which led to Trump's retreat from his exaggerated threats, and that this change reflects the failure of the method of ""diplomatic edge of the abyss"" that Trump relied on in Click on the parties concerned to achieve its goals.

And they point out that the concerns are increasing that Trump's statements may be just a tool to impose a new political reality in Gaza, as Trump is working to enhance pressure on the Palestinian resistance to make concessions that may lead to changes in the political and military scene of the region.

Trump retracted his threats due to the unified Arab position

The writer and political analyst specializing in Israeli affairs, Dr. Hussein Al -Deek, believes that US President Donald Trump's retreat from his threats on the Gaza Strip came as a result of a unified Arab position. Stressing that the collective political will by Arab governments and peoples is able to break American pressure and positions.

The rooster explains that the United States, despite its arrogance, is not an inevitable amount, and its policies can be faced and thwarted if there is a strict and clear Arab position.

Al -Deek notes that Trump's retreat from his hostile statements on Gaza reflects his failure to use what is known as the ""brink of the abyss"", which is based on severe pressure to achieve political goals.

Al -Deek explains that this method did not succeed in the stiffness of the Arab position rejecting his statements, which assured the world that Trump is a dialectical and popular figure, and he often issues narcissistic statements that are not implemented.

Regarding the issue of Israeli prisoners and detainees in the Gaza Strip, Al -Deek confirms that the Hamas movement showed a clear commitment to the signed agreement, which requires the release of three prisoners per week according to the specified plan, indicating that any violation of this agreement came from the Israeli side with American support.

Al -Deek notes that the Israeli occupation did not abide by the humanitarian part of the agreement, as it prevented the entry of the necessary equipment to remove the rubble, and it was not allowed to enter the houses. Mobile and agreed tents.

The rooster asserts that Israel's approval of the deal came under great internal pressure, as the Benjamin Netanyahu government faces pressure from the Haredim parties and from the Israeli street, in addition to the position of the military establishment that exhausted its goals in Gaza, which prompted Netanyahu to move forward despite its frequency.

On the expected scenarios of the future of the agreement, the rooster explains that there are four possible scenarios: either the completion of the stages of the deal as planned, although this scenario appears weak due to Netanyahu's delay in completing the first stage, especially since the second stage of negotiations has not started yet, and remains less than Two weeks since the end of the first stage.

As for the scenario, the second scenario, according to the rooster, is related to the tour of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the Middle East, where he visited Tel Aviv, then a number of Arab countries, to discuss new arrangements aimed at expanding and extending the first stage of the agreement.

The rooster explains that this scenario has the support of Netanyahu, who convinced the Americans, but his success depends on the position of Hamas and the extent of Israel's commitment to implementing the initial agreement.

The rooster indicates that the scenario The third is linked to the Arab summit to be held in Cairo on the 27th of this month.
Al-Deek notes that media reports talk about an Egyptian-Arab initiative on the management of the Gaza Strip, which includes the management of the sector through Palestinian experts and technicians under Arab and international supervision, with Hamas excluded from the ruling.

Al -Deek believes that this scenario is likely, given the Palestinian and Arab rejection of the plan to displace the people of Gaza, and the severe Israeli opposition to the return of the Palestinian Authority to the Strip.

With regard to the fourth scenario, according to the rooster, it is based on the return of military operations in the Gaza Strip after the end of the first stage of the agreement.

The rooster considers that this scenario is weak, justifying that the Trump administration looks at the region from the perspective of commercial deals, not wars, and that the resumption of war will hinder the investment plans that the American administration desires, especially from the Gulf states.

Al-Deek notes that the upcoming meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia may contribute to strengthening American-Arab understandings and reducing the chances of military escalation.

The rooster confirms that the unified Arab position and regional understandings play a pivotal role in the face of American and Israeli policies, which makes the unity of the Arab ranks a major tool for protecting national and national interests in the next stage.

Trump did not retract his initial plans to displace the Gazans

The writer and political researcher d. Tamara Haddad said that US President Donald Trump has not retracted his initial plans related to the forced displacement of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, but rather is still determined to implement these plans.

Haddad notes that Trump has handed over the final decision to implement this deal to Israel, considering that the United States of America will remain part of ensuring the implementation of the agreements related to Gaza, but it is retracting its role as a major decision maker, and therefore, Israel will have the freedom to make final decisions regarding the deal, This reflects the complete intersection between Trump and the thought of the Israeli government, which seeks to produce the largest possible number of Israeli prisoners.

Haddad explains that the decline that appeared in Trump's statements is not a strategic decline, but a tactical, as the implementation of the first stage of the deal, which includes the removal of the prisoners, is in the interest of Israel.

Haddad notes that this stage may extend for a longer period than The expected, as Israel seeks to collect the largest possible number of hostages, to ensure a pressure tool on the Palestinian side.

Haddad believes that the equation imposed in the first stage of the deal is a purely human equation, so that humanitarian aid and residential caravans are introduced in exchange for the removal of Israeli hostages, and therefore any progress towards the second or third stages of the deal will only take place on specific conditions, set by the Israeli Prime Minister. Benjamin Netanyahu, among these conditions, highlights the demand to remove the leading leaders of Hamas from the Gaza Strip, in addition to ensuring that the sector is not It poses a future threat to Israeli national security.

Haddad notes that Israel does not want to enter the second and third phases of the deal at the present time, due to the security and economic benefits that may entail it, such as the full withdrawal from Gaza and the reconstruction.

Haddad pointed out that Israel does not want to perform the reconstruction process quickly, as it considers that the Palestinian citizen may be proven on his land even if the reconstruction is temporary, which enhances his resilience.

Haddad believes that the primary goal of the American and Israeli escalation is Imposing a new reality in Gaza, with a focus on the human equation in exchange for taking the hostages.

On the Arab level, Haddad confirms that there is an urgent need for a coordinated Arab plan to confront the Israeli and American plans related to displacement.

Haddad considers that the Arab plan may focus on removing Hamas from the political scene to withdraw excuses from Israel and the United States of America, while emphasizing the need for this plan to be acceptable to Palestinian, regionally and internationally.

Haddad explains that the situation in Gaza may lead to the extension of the first stage of the deal or to form a transitional stage similar to the first stage, in an attempt by the Israeli and American parties to pressure Hamas more through the worsening human reality.

Haddad confirms that the political future in Gaza remains mysterious, and that the situation requires urgent Arab coordination to face the challenges that occur in the Palestinian issue.

Arab and regional moves that started to provide alternatives and plans

The writer and political analyst Suleiman Bisharat believes that the high statements made by Trump on Gaza carry a major goal to raise the ceiling in the rhythm of the parties concerned in a state of shock. With the aim of rearranging priorities in line with the Israeli -American vision of the region.

It was terrified, according to Bisharat, through these statements, he wanted to introduce new variables in the conflict based on Gaza, especially as it relates to the future of the Strip after the war, and to restore a balance between the active forces in the region, and his open threat to open the ""doors of hell"" as he described it, and affirming the possibility of disrupting The agreements if their path is not adhered to, a pressure tool to force the parties to comply with Washington's vision.

Bisharat believes that the second goal of this escalation is to activate the populist discourse that resonates with the hard -line Israeli right, which enhances the consensus between the American and Israeli position. Thus, Trump wanted, in addition to making the Israeli position more in line with the American vision, which explains the escalation of the speech and then retracting it after a short period.

With the American retreat from some statements, Bisharat believes that Trump may have achieved his basic goals, which was a shock to the parties concerned and forced them to amend their policies, and thus began to rearrange the papers according to the American vision.

Bisharat indicates the presence of Arab moves Regionalism began to provide alternatives and plans to deal with the future situation in Gaza, which reflects the impact of American statements in igniting new dynamics in the region.

Bisharat believes that Trump's implementation of his threats is very difficult, as the Palestinians in Gaza have lost everything, and they have nothing to lose if they decide to reject what the United States is proposing, and the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the sector made it difficult for America to appear as the weak in Confronting the destruction left by the war.

Bisharat considers that the Palestinian resistance has proven its ability to absorb American and Israeli pressure, as it dealt with caution and realism with events in order to avoid granting Israel or Trump the excuse to resume the war or escalation.

The resistance, according to Bisharat, realizes that things are no longer just improvised reactions, but rather have become part of accurate political accounts that include the Palestinian, international and regional dimensions.

Bisharat believes that the current situation is still mysterious, and there is no real perception of the parties concerned on how to deal with Gaza after the war, and despite the passage of more than 15 months of the war, the parties have not reached final solutions on the future The politician of the sector, however, there are perceptions and visions circulating by these parties, but they will not be effective, unless there is a consensus between all parties.

Bisharat explains that the most realistic scenario for the next stage indicates that there is a kind of balance between the Palestinian resistance and Israel, with the support of the United States, and in this scenario, any proposed agreement will be a consensus between the Palestinian resistance and the international parties.

The other scenario, according to Bisharat, is the crazy scenario in which Israel, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, may seek to exploit the hesitant American position to pressure the other parties to achieve its political goals.

Bisharat believes that the situation in the Gaza Strip will remain in a state of constant instability, as long as the existing agreements will not be fixed or easily implemented, which makes them vulnerable to the manipulation of the various parties and the introduction of changes that may empty the agreements from their content, and therefore the Palestinian situation in Gaza remains its place in A circle of political escalation, until real consensus is reached that guarantee long -term stability.

Trump from the role of the mediator to a direct party in the pressure

The writer and political researcher, Dr. Salah's mind that US President Donald tried, through his promises, attempted to exert extensive pressure on the resistance to accept the conditions of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and despite this, Trump was aware that the resistance would not be acquies from these threats.

Salah notes that Trump also practiced pressure on the Qatari and Egyptian intermediaries to push them to influence the resistance, which led to the implementation of the sixth batch of the deal, but Israel has dismissed its obligations and refused to enter aid to Gaza after that.

Salah confirms that the major crisis lies in the fact that Trump, who is supposed to be a mediator and a security of the agreement, is the one who encouraged Netanyahu to violate it, which represents a serious precedent in the role of international mediators, through this absolute support for Israel, and Trump is seeking to save Netanyahu from the responsibility for disrupting the agreement And hold the resistance responsibility instead.

Salah refers to Trump's transformation from the role of the mediator to a direct party to pressure the resistance, with the aim of reducing its political and field achievements.

Salah explains that Israel broke up for the sixth batch due to the increasing pressure from the Israeli street and the Trump administration, as Netanyahu seeks to Achieving gains through negotiations did not achieve through the war.

Salah expects the American pressure to continue the resistance to push it to a settlement that gives Netanyahu a political achievement that preserves the cohesion of his government coalition and provides a moral victory for Israel.

Salah warns that the seventh batch of the deal is facing the risk of disruption due to the disintegration of Israel from the introduction of humanitarian aid, stressing that the resistance may refuse to complete the deal unless Israel is committed to the terms of the agreement.
Salah believes that the next stage will be arduous, as its success is closely related to the movement of the Israeli street to pressure his government.

Salah notes that the post -war American arrangements in Gaza place resistance in front of major challenges, as it cannot rely on the role of brokers without clear guarantees to implement the agreed humanitarian obligations.


Multiple angles to explain Trump's threats

Dr. Raed Al -Dubai, Head of Political Science at An -Najah National University, believes that Trump's retreat from his previous threats, which included ""opening the gates of hell"" if not all Israeli hostages are released by Saturday, can be explained by several angles.

Al -Dabi considers that the threats he made Trump is commensurate with his populist and emotional personality, as he is known for his escalating and exaggerated style in his speeches, and therefore his threats to Hamas was part of this approach that depends on shock and exaggeration with the aim of attracting attention, without necessarily having a realistic plan to implement these threats.

Al -Dabi is cited previous experiences of Trump, where he fired fiery statements and then retracted it when he discovered that they are not implementable or when he faced internal or external pressures. For example, during his first term, Trump had issued threats against North Korea and China, but he returned later to change His positions after realizing that these threats may lead to reverse results.

Al -Dubai believes that Trump's great pressure from his advisers in the American administration, in addition to international pressure from allies and partners in the region, especially in the context of mediation on the exchange deal, which led him to adopt a more cautious and coordination position with Israel.

Al -Dabi believes that Trump was seeking to present himself as a firefighting man in the world, especially with regard to the Palestinian file, as he had succeeded in a ceasefire previously, and from here, the escape of matters at this time, Before returning the detainees, he contradicts the image he wants to hold for himself.

Al -Dabi believes that Israel, on the other hand, chose to put its national interests above any other consideration, which explains its approval to complete the prisoner exchange deal despite Trump's threats.

Al -Dabi considers that this Israeli position reflects the effectiveness of indirect negotiations and a real desire to restore the detainees, which may be the result of internal pressure from the families of the hostages and the Israeli public opinion.

As for the future scenarios, Al -Dabi believes that the Hamas and Islamic Jihad movement possesses prisoners, especially the neighborhoods of them, and that the second stage of the deal, which includes the release of intelligence officers, may put Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu under great pressure.

Al -Dabi believes that Netanyahu will make an effort to extend the first phase of the deal in order to avoid discussing the issue of stopping the war, which may affect the stability of his government coalition, but Al -Dabi indicates that, in the end, Netanyahu will have to discuss the second stage of the deal, which includes a comprehensive ceasefire of shooting .

With regard to Netanyahu's position on the end of the war, Al -Dabi believes that the Prime Minister The Israeli does not want a comprehensive stop of the fire, because it means his exit from the government and political scene, but at the same time he does not have many options due to the increasing pressure from home and abroad.

According to Da`i, the features of the second stage of the deal will determine a set of data and developments, including the position of the American administration, the pressure that it may exercise on Israel, in addition to the developments of the military field.
He points out that Netanyahu is not the only player who decides in these circumstances, but will rely in the future on the balance of strength at home and abroad to determine his directions.

Trump's character is governed by the merchant's mindset

The writer and political analyst Sri Samour believes that the personality of US President Donald Trump is governed by the merchant's mindset, as he used to put forward very high demands with the aim of obtaining negotiating gains, which was reflected in his behavior towards Gaza.

Samour notes that this approach is derived from the background of Trump in the real estate sector, as it depends on the maximum bargaining to achieve its goals, despite the presence of American institutions that limit its decisions.

Samour explains that Trump tends to escalate, but he is retreating to diplomacy whenever he faces real resistance to his proposals, citing the transformation of his positions from Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who moved from the threat to rapprochement after realizing their hardness.

On the Israeli scene, Samour indicates unannounced arrangements between Washington and Tel Aviv that go beyond Trump's public statements, but he believes that the United States, at this stage, will not provide financial and military support to Israel with the same generosity that President Joe Biden provided.

Samour explains that Israel is seeking to resume the war in Gaza and cancel the second stage of the agreement or integrate it according to its own conditions, continuing to fabricate crises to achieve its goals.

Samour warns of a catastrophic scenario of pushing the Arab countries to provide bad solutions for fear of Trump's threats to displace the inhabitants of Gaza, as this fear may lead to crystallizing uncomfortable Arab plans aimed at only thwarting the displacement plan.

Samour notes that there is a media reading that Trump's statements aim to restore the image of the Arab regimes that have received widespread criticism because of its silence during the events of Gaza, but it does not tend to this opinion, but rather believes that Trump's goal is to push the Arabs to formulate a political plan, which may not include a displacement In full, but a partial displacement that holds consequences Dangerous.

Samour emphasizes the importance of Arab caution against drifting behind any uncompromising plans, stressing that the stage requires a deep political awareness to face a dangerous wrap scenarios on the Palestinian issue.",PS

During the first weeks of President Trump administration, the Saudi role in several regional files became clear, perhaps the most prominent of which was the Lebanese file, which witnessed a different president and a different prime minister as well, and the formation of a faster government than what the Lebanese clock used to.

Union is on the throne of the lead
What does a decline and supporters mean?
The Saudi role was also supportive of the Egyptian Qatari efforts, seeking a ceasefire in Gaza, and the success of the prisoners ’exchange, and he still has some steps to complete the following stages. Speaking of the Saudi position on Palestine, there was a clear statement from the Saudi Foreign Ministry about its rejection of what was stated in the Netanyahu meeting and Tremb, about the displacement of the Palestinians.
Here, it appears, pointing out that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has drawn a clear line in the sand that does not affect its conviction in peace according to the Arab Peace Initiative announced at the Arab Summit in Beirut 2002, which provides for normalization with all Arab countries, in exchange for a Palestinian state on the June 1976 borders, its capital, Jerusalem East.
This clear and direct difference with the US President's statements, although Riyadh is its first destination, indicates that Saudi Arabia has its place and its estimated political position, and an important partner for Washington, even if we disagree with the Biden administration on files, or we disagreed with the Trump administration on other files.
The evidences indicating the increasing position politically and economically for the Kingdom, and to His Highness the Crown Prince as a leader with a great position in The world, and the intuitive incubator of any global summit or conference, has become to host the summit of President Putin and Tremb, which takes place in Riyadh with the participation of His Highness the Crown Prince as an ideal destination, as Riyadh represented a positive neutrality in this file in support of the exchange of prisoners and the entry of humanitarian aid.
Success usually brings grudging from the envious, but the Kingdom with its approach seeks to do what is appropriate for its people first and for its nation second, and for the good of the third world, and whoever seeks to do the correct does not ask whether what I do is delights or not.",SA
"Although some believe that the departure of the Secretary -General of Hezbollah, Sheikh Naim Qassem, to announce the refusal to extend the sixty -day period of the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Lebanese territories, came outside the context hours after the announcement of the Lebanese government in which the party is represented as the Speaker of the Parliament Nabih Berri who And all by negotiating it throughout the last war, they followed the extension. It does not concern us neither from near nor from far and does not exist in our calendar. ”

This party's position sparked many people, while others put it in the framework of the maneuvering style that the party used to avoid frustrating its environment, especially after thousands flocked to their villages since last Sunday with the end of the sixty -day period stipulated in the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah.

Declared situations
Qasim stressed in a speech, on Monday, that the extension of the deadline for Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon means that ""we are facing an occupation that is assaulting and refusing to withdraw, and the resistance has the right to act what it deems appropriate about the form of confrontation And its nature and timing, ""stressing that"" Israel must withdraw with the passage of sixty days, and we do not accept any justification for extending one day and we do not accept the extension of the deadline. ""

On Sunday evening, the White House announced the extension of the arrangements for the ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel until February 18th, and the start of American mediation talks on the return of the Lebanese prisoners who were captured after October 7, 2023.

The head of the caretaker government, Naguib Mikati, announced that Lebanon agreed to extend the deadline for not giving Israel any excuse for not withdrawing from all Lebanese territory. The Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri explained that he stipulated an immediate ceasefire, breaches, house destruction, and others, in addition to pledged the issue of the prisoners.

Persians and dismissal of obligations
Dr. Sami Nader, Director of the Mashreq Center for Strategic Affairs, considered that “(Hezbollah) used to adopt this method in terms of playing contradictions to expand the margin of its maneuver and disavow any commitment, and this is dangerous; He keeps himself outside the framework of legitimacy in what is a representative in the Council of Ministers and the authority takes what he wants from it and dismisses his decisions when he likes it.

While Nader was excluded in a statement Asharq Al -Awsat has the withdrawal of Israel during the new deadline specified on February 18, it is suggested that ""the argument that Hezbollah's weapon is a threat to it, especially since the content of the ceasefire agreement allows it to do so. Despite the defeat incurred by (Hezbollah), Israel has not achieved its goal from the recent war by returning the residents of Galilee to their homes, knowing that the only party that is able to force Israel to withdraw is the United States of America.

For his part, retired Munir Shehadeh, the former coordinator of the Lebanese government at UNIFIL, indicated that ""the position of (Hezbollah) and its environment is clear and frank with the refusal to extension, and they are behaving on the ground on this basis since the dawn of Sunday when the popular crawl began with naked breasts."" He explained in a statement to Asharq Al -Awsat that ""the party explicitly informed those concerned with its refusal to extend, but the American pressure on political power made it It agrees to an extension of February 18, which constitutes an embarrassment and a setback for the start of the covenant.

However, Shehadeh, unlike Sami Nader, is likely to have an Israeli withdrawal with The new deadline ends after American pressure, and it excludes any return to military confrontations.

Hezbollah is confusing
As for the political activist and editor -in -chief of the ""South"" website, Ali Al -Amin, he saw that the position of Hezbollah rejecting the armistice ""falls within the framework of the justified political position, without this position being arranged by any behavior that violates the position of the Lebanese state"", suggesting that the party will not exceed the official political position. ; ""Because it is overlooked or done by any material or military action, it will have consequences for the party itself primarily and Lebanon in general, at least that Israel will be a cold in exchange for that I do not think that the party, nor the sons of the devastating towns and villages, can accept that the situation go towards new confrontations.""

In a statement to Asharq Al -Awsat, the Secretary put the party’s position in the framework of its endeavor to impose internal facts that violate the obligations included in the implementation of Resolution 1701, which he had approved. What is the legitimacy of his weapon, and this is a desperate attempt that will not find a way to the text of the statement. ”

Al -Amin concluded by saying: “It seems that the party is looking for outlets for internal chaos, which provides a movement space for its weapon, which has become an external and semi -restriction. I became internally escaping and awaiting that the Lebanese state, which is still confusing just as the party, is not less confused but rather much more. ”",PS

According to the newspaper, Trump, who pledged to stop wars around the world, and that he does not want another conflict in the Middle East, is under pressure from Israel, which considers that Tehran is in a period of maximum weakness after the war on Gaza and Lebanon and the fall of Bashar al -Assad's regime in Syria.

The newspaper quoted US and Israeli officials as saying that Israel wants to seize the opportunity, and if Iran does not agree to abandon its nuclear facilities, similar to what happened in Libya, Israel is ready to bomb these facilities, with the support of or without the United States.

They added that the Biden administration was studying in its last days whether it would support this Israeli threat or not, but it decided not to do so. Now this threat has become the highest issues Introduction to Trump, according to the newspaper.

She added that the United States has provided Israel with supernatural ammunition, which would severely damage Iranian centrifuges and other uranium enrichment equipment buried in a mountain fort in Fordo, near Qom.

In an interview with ""Fox News"" recently, Trump said about the possibilities of attacking Iran that ""everyone believes that Israel, with our help or approval, will enter and bomb them. It is better not to happen this. I prefer to see a deal with Iran where we can conclude a deal and supervise it And verify it, search it, then detonate it, or make sure that there are no more nuclear facilities. ""

He added, ""There are two ways to stop them: with bombs or a written piece of paper. I am very better to reach an agreement.""

""I think Iran is very tense. I think they are afraid. I think Iran will love the conclusion of a deal, and I love to conclude a deal with them without bombing them,"" Trump added, saying that after the Israeli attack on Iran, last October, ""he disappeared. Their air defense is largely. ""

The options, and this does not preach much. The conditions set by Netanyahu are almost impossible for Hamas because they are In its entirety, it means that it is completely surrendering, that is, to leave the scene permanently and hand over its weapon. It provides these conditions insulting even without preserving its face water, and he realizes that the Palestinian movement cannot accept it, as it means that it agrees to execute itself as a resistance movement. What does it mean that the resistance is stripped of its weapon? But Netanyahu is more intelligent and here is the dilemma of the movement and the Palestinians who always put them in a devastating dualism: either surrender or completing the displacement project. This time, too, Netanyahu does not want to reach a solution as the ends of previous wars, and most importantly, he does not wait for the movement to surrender, in its surrender, the justification of war and displacement ends Searching for the return of life to Gaza and its reconstruction, as happened in Germany and Japan. But Netanyahu raised a roof The conditions for the movement to reject because this time he wants to ""uproot Germany and Japan"", not to allow Arab countries to implement the Marshall project for the sector, which is what Arab politics is trying to crystallize and present it to the White House and its implementation, which is clashing with Israeli aspirations and desires.

The occupation boats had fired its machine gun towards the beach of the Khan Yunis city, south of the Gaza Strip, and towards the Beach of the Rafah Sea, while the occupation mechanisms fired lighting bombs in the sky of the estate area west of Rafah.

The occupation mechanisms stationed east of the town of Beit Hanoun, in the northern Gaza Strip, also fired its machine guns towards the lands of citizens in the town.

Since the seventh of October 2023, the Israeli occupation has launched a genocide war on the Gaza Strip, which resulted in the death of 48,271 citizens, the majority of whom were children and women, and the injury of 111,693 others, in an indisputable outcome, as a number of victims are still under the rubble, and cannot be able Ambulance and Civil Defense crews reach them.",PS

"Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar considered that there are disturbing developments for Tel Aviv in the Iranian nuclear project, according to the Hebrew media on Monday.

Saar's talk came during a meeting held last night with a delegation from the American Senate headed by Senator Lindsay Graham, and with the participation of Morgan Ortigas, the deputy of the US President's Special Envoy to the Middle East.

""There are disturbing developments (not revealed) in the Iranian nuclear project,"" Saar said, according to a statement of the Israeli Foreign Ministry.

He added that these developments ""stem from Iran's desire to compensate for its weak regional strength due to the war by obtaining nuclear weapons.""

Israel and its ally, the United States, accuses Iran of seeking to produce nuclear weapons, while Tehran says its program is designed for civil peaceful purposes, including generating electricity.

Israel is the only country in the Middle East with a nuclear weapon arsenal, and it is not subject to international control, and has not officially announced it, and has occupied lands for lands in Palestine, Syria and Lebanon.

Saar stressed ""Israel's commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.""

Both Israel and Iran are the other country, its first enemy, For years, they have been accused of responsibility for targeting and electronic attacks.

When Saar was asked about the possibility of the withdrawal of the American forces from Syria, he answered: ""In my opinion, this will not be the right move at the present time, given the fight against ISIS (ISIS), and the new situation in Syria, especially attempts to undermine the Kurdish autonomy,"" He claimed.

There are American media reports that US President Donald Trump intends to withdraw his country's forces from the Kurdish control areas in Syria.

A few days ago, Trump said, in press statements: ""We will make a decision in this regard (the fate of the forces), we are not involved in Syria. Syria has enough chaos and they do not need to participate in everything.""

Saar, the new situation in Syria, means the control of Syrian factions on the capital, Damascus, on December 8, ending 61 years of the rule of the bloody Baath Party and 53 years of the control of the Assad family.

Since 1967, Israel has occupied most of the area of ??the Syrian Golan Heights, and after the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad (2000-2024), the Syrian buffer zone occupied, and it was destroyed by air strikes, military sites, equipment and ammunition for the Syrian army.",PS
"The multiple moves in the face of the ""Displacement"" plan of ""Termbea"", and as we said previously, ""The man put forward a high price and is now waiting for prices"", and this was confirmed by his envoy ""Steve Witkev"" who said, ""Trump's statements regarding the possession of Gaza encouraged many talks, the Egyptians And the Jordanians say that they have a plan and everyone is involved in a continuous discussion, ""which clearly indicates the real goal of that The statements, created a climate that requires Arab countries to engage and intervene in Gaza to disarm the post -war resistance and after Israel was unable to do so, where the former chief of staff and former war council member, Gadi Eisenkot, says: I do not know an army that managed to eliminate terrorism without controlling On the ground and the population, so what is required now is to return the Israeli prisoners from Gaza. ""
If Israel cannot achieve it, President Trump wants to present a gift to Israel by offering plans for reconstruction in the essence of the nature of government and the nature of the new security arrangements and by non -Israeli hands, then Israel has implemented the required of it by converting the Gaza Strip into a dancer to life by converting it into a pile of rubble, it is true that it has not achieved victory Not by achieving goals or via imposition Surrendering on the resistance, but it imposed great data and challenges on the ground the most important repercussions and the minimum is the removal of ""Hamas"" from the scene of the next ruling, but this is not practically and realistic without the disarmament of the division and resistance, so the displacement plans moves according to an agreed mechanism between ""Netanyahu"" and Trump, and it is clear from the statement of ""Netanyahu"" by saying, ""The gates of hell will open in Gaza, according to a joint plan With Trump, ""that is, the issue of"" displacement ""is not only on the table, but plans were developed"" the statements of Defense Minister Katz about the establishment of a department in the Ministry of Defense to encourage immigration ""and consensus between the two parties.
The phenomenon of trembling is a natural condition that affects almost every human being, but it does not lead to resistance and those who have the right to fear and make fateful decisions without reading it well and exploring its welfare and scrutinizing it with extreme accuracy, while the trembling is already when they are directly exposed to the ""trembling phenomenon"" that dominates terror and begins to search for solutions that satisfy the master Al -Sayed continued, especially since the nature of the trembling when the shivering occurs The distance between them becomes not seen with the naked eye. It does not turn towards the formula of trembling and whatever the aids are bright, and it works to stabilize these people and tighten their trembling legs because it is the most capable of facing the phenomenon of trembling, especially since the trembling does not have their decision and will work according to what the White House master wants even in a way and another color, that is, the application of what he wants to follow the ""Mr."" One of the goals to say to his master, let's postpone the ""displacement"" for some time because our plan is announced in the ""channel 14 ""I became known"" Gaza without kidnappers ... Gaza without enthusiasm and resistance ... Gaza without Gazans "", so we must first release the prisoners and the detainees and protect them to introduce heavy tools, caravans, sustainable calm and reconstruction against the head of Hamas and the resistance, and then we will not be overpowered in Finding excuses for the displacement of the Ghaazians.
The issue of displacement is not new to the Palestinian people, but today it comes in light of a Palestinian and Arab awareness and in light of the presence of resistance, and besides there is a Palestinian division and an official Arab and Palestinian deterioration, in addition to the exposure of the axis of resistance and resistance in the region to a major blow, which encourages the ""Zionist Dini"" and with it ""Christian Christian Zionism"" that dominates the White House to take steps based on these accounts and what He pushes towards the dream of ""Netanyahu"" to bring about a change of ""political geo"" in the West Asia region ""the Middle East"", and this requires first and foremost the liquidation of the Palestinian issue, that is, the displacement of the Palestinians as a whole from the geography between the sea and the river, the imposition of sovereignty on the West Bank and the giving of the White House "" The Gaza Strip is a ""gift to establish the largest"" casino ""in the world"" called Rivera Middle East. ""
We said that there is a Palestinian and Arab awareness and that there is also resistance despite the great strikes it suffered, so despite everything that happened, the attempt to reach the utmost benefit, which will actually bring a radical coup will turn in the opposite direction, everything ""carries inside it"" and these accounts may be It is based on delusions due to the mirage of reality. Sahih is required by ""Hamas"" and ""resistance"" great flexibility regarding the scene of the ruling in the Gaza Strip, but this Flexibility must have red lines and do not lead to ""trembling"" to exploit them according to the ""West Bank"" scene, flexibility does not mean surrender, and flexibility does not mean the slogan of delivery of everything ""above the earth and underground"" or ""from the door to the mihrab"", because good faith With the ""Netanyahu"" and ""Trump"", it means the implementation of the ""displacement"" plan, and here the various Palestinian forces must On top of it, the resistance fasted to call urgently to a public national conference, even if it is in the Gaza Strip despite the situation it is witnessing to announce the rejection of the displacement plan and the plan to strip the resistance of its power, and to emphasize the path of the two countries in accordance with international legitimacy resolutions, and so that the resistance turns as part of the Palestinian army or security The Palestinian national, but in the context of a political settlement leading to the establishment of a Palestinian state.
Always the distance zero is an exclusive specialization for resistance, and we saw this on television screens, so it is forbidden to hand this specialization to the ""trembling"" because they are in the moment What governs them, and we say a transgression is ""goodwill"" in the master of the land, and the master who wants to steal part Including, and this is considered forced ""flexibility"" to prevent theft plans called ""displacement"", and you believe that making great concessions the size of the disposal of ""resistance"" will stop plans whose files have been decided from dealing with the UNRWA agency "" A law issued by the Israeli ""Knesset"", through what is going on in The West Bank, especially in its camps, especially in the northern region of them, and not an end to what happened and happens in ""Gaza"", that they want to impose sovereignty on the West Bank and displace the Palestinians as a whole, starting from Gaza.
The prevention of the ""trembling"" from setting plans in it is what is in it and it has what is on it, and not dealing with the concepts of ""goodwill"" and dealing in accordance with the requirements of the supreme national interest, first calling for the Palestinian -Arab coordination in every small and large first, and rejecting any formula that achieves the non -announced goals second. And the maximum flexibility regarding the scene of the rule ""Gaza Administration"" third, and dealing with the second stage of the prisoner exchange agreement Comprehensively so that there is no third stage and so that everything is officially agreed upon, written and located and is also placed in the UN term to become an international agreement, and not only an agreement with guarantees, because the guarantor is the one who raises theft of ""Gaza"" from its indigenous owners.
I point out here that the Palestinian issue is at a crossroads, and it seems that the American and the Israeli want first to obtain their families while stripping the resistance from its weapons and removing it from the scene of the ruling in Gaza, and if you do not accept its disarmament, we will hear a new proposal, which is the extension of the first stage Or finding a stage between the two phases, in an attempt to laugh at ""Hamas"" to obtain their families and after that they carry out their plans, as something may happen greater than that and the region is witnessing a great escalation by targeting ""Iran"" militarily and in a way that leads to confusion of the whole scene in the region and exploiting this to carry out the accountability of the displacement This requires attention and not to agree to their malicious games.",PS

"Hezbollah has launched 5 drones towards Israeli territory in recent weeks, during the validity of the ceasefire agreement, according to Israeli Army Radio, on Monday.

The Israeli Army Radio mentioned that Hezbollah launched 5 marches towards Israel since the ceasefire agreement has passed 4, including airspace.

According to the radio report, the Israeli army kept the process of launching marches from Lebanese territory towards Israeli territory, and only confessed in one case, as the public published the details of one case, knowing that 4 marches passed the Israeli airspace.

It is estimated that all the drones launched by Hezbollah are reconnaissance aircraft, but it is unclear why the Israeli army refrains from announcing and reporting these infiltrations of marches to the public.

This comes, while the Israeli army is supposed to withdraw, on Tuesday, from Lebanon, but the inhabitants of the north, according to the Israeli army radio, are still living in a reality in which Hezbollah drones fly over their heads. Despite the confidence crisis, the Israeli army has declined to inform the public.

It reported Israeli media about Israeli estimates that the army intends to withdraw from southern Lebanon within days, coinciding with the spread of the Lebanese army.

According to estimates, Israel is still demanding military control over 5 strategic points along the border with Lebanon, while Israel does not rule out the extension of the ceasefire with Lebanon again, which means that its army is given an additional period to complete its withdrawal from southern Lebanon.

The Israeli army did not specify a new date to complete the withdrawal from southern Lebanon, but the official Israeli radio stated that Tel Aviv asked the ICRC to monitor the ceasefire agreement to extend the survival of its forces until February 28, that is, for an additional ten days, which was rejected by the Lebanese side.

According to the statement of the army, which was issued before the night of Monday night, ""it was decided to pay major reinforcements for the forces in the security tasks in the region, as this measure will contribute to strengthening the security situation in the region, and the forces' willingness to various scenarios in it.""",PS
"Very reckless statements talking about Israel's responsibility - as an occupation force - about providing services to Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem in the event of the implementation of the Knesset Law to ban the work of the UNRWA agency in the occupied Palestinian territories.
The goal of the law
According to the Knesset, the law issued on October 28, 2024 aims to ""prevent any activity to UNRWA in the territory of the State of Israel, and stipulates that UNRWA does not employ any representative office, and does not provide any service directly or indirectly in the territory of the State of Israel And, provided that the law enters into force after 90 days of its approval.
Accordingly, it is assumed from the end of January 2025 that the Israeli foreign ministries and the interior will not issue entry or work permits for the agency's employees and refrain from dealing with their requests, and Israeli banks will face difficulties in providing banking services to the agency, and the Israeli army will have to cut labor ties With the agency, including the government business coordinator with Palestinian authorities, through ""UNRWA"".
Cortina Ratray, head of the UN Secretary -General Antonio Guterres, considered that Israel, with this measure, would have officially decided to withdraw its recognition of ""UNRWA"" and the Komai -McLimore agreement for the year 1967, which organizes the work of the authority in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, ""noting that"" it is not the responsibility of the United Nations to replace An alternative to UNRWA and we are not able to do this, and that the United Nations ""does not bear any responsibility for finding an alternative to the agency's operations in Gaza and the West Bank, And that this problem falls on Israel as an occupying power.
""In the event that UNRWA is unable to provide its services, Israel must provide the same educational and health services, and others, which UNRWA provides.""
""In the absence of UNRWA or official Palestinian institutions, the State of Israel - as an occupying power - will have to provide assistance and services to the population in all occupied Palestinian land, including Gaza"", and the use of Lazarini called the name ""Population"" instead of ""refugees"" in it from political connotations Dangerous; That the content of the law according to the Commissioner -General's statement - in the event of a dish - means removing the refugee of the Palestinian, which he carried since the Nakba of Palestine in the year 1948, or the setback of Palestine in the year 1967.
These statements are considered a recklessness in the United Nations system, with experts and jurists of international law, and systematically contradicts what it identified and spoke about the responsibility of the UNHCR (UNHCR), towards Palestinian refugees. Article 1 of the 1951 agreement stipulated on the 1951 agreement, Ali Ali “This agreement does not apply to people who are currently protection or assistance from bodies or agencies United Nations is not the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. ”
The Palestinian refugees here are meant, and the article adds that if this protection stops or assistance for any reason without the fate of these people has been permanently level according to the related decisions adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, these people, as a result, become qualified to enjoy the benefits of this agreement "".
Article 29 of the guidelines issued by the High Commissioner for Refugees have been stressed on December The first of 2017, and it was prepared in close cooperation between the High Commissioner for Refugees and the UNRWA, and was approved by member states, that ""when the protection or assistance of UNRWA stops, the Palestinian refugee will automatically have the right to presentations according to the 1951 Treaty."" .
The strange statements of the United Nations team stems from the fact that Guterres and before his appointment as Secretary -General of the United Nations, he worked as a general commissioner for the High Commissioner for Refugees for a period of 10 years, and the full science knows what the first article ""D"" contains the agreement on protecting Palestinian refugees, if it was arrested. UNRWA ""for its services.
This is in addition to the fact that the United Nations call for Israel to bear a country that occupies humanitarian responsibility towards Palestinian refugees, is an entirely contradictory invitation in exchange for what is going on on the ground by the occupation towards Gaza and the West Bank and Jerusalem from daily violations of human rights that are brought up by the forehead with a distant and near testimony.
In addition to that Israel is involved in collective annihilation, because of it the International Criminal Court issued its decision to arrest both Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Gallant, on charges of crimes against Humanity, war crimes, including the use of starvation as a weapon, the mass displacement of the Palestinians, and other inhumane acts.
Lazarini - who is the veteran and graduated man in responsibilities in various positions at the United Nations - is aware of the content of the aforementioned article, but he has not been indicated to it, since 2020 he has the position of UNRWA Commissioner He worked as a deputy for the United Nations Special Coordinator, and the resident and humanized coordinator in Lebanon.
The state of surprise becomes broader and more comprehensive when the High Commissioner of the High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grande is silent about the content of the agreement, and he previously worked as a general commissioner for UNRWA from 2005 until 2014, and defended it for years, and he always called for not to be replaced by any organization Others.
All other international organizations officials did not mention this fate for Palestinian refugees if ""UNRWA"" was arrested, and Anasa Kalamar, the Secretary -General of Amnesty International, was satisfied with saying: ""This unreasonable law constitutes an explicit attack on the rights of Palestinian refugees. It is clear that it is clear The aim of it is to make the agency's work in the occupied Palestinian land, impossible by imposing the closure of its headquarters in East Jerusalem, and ending entry visas for its employees. It promises to criminalize humanitarian aid, and will exacerbate the already worsening humanitarian humanitarian crisis. ""
Israel's official position did not mention this agreement; Because the occupying state wants its strategy to get rid of the name of a refugee; In order to give her the way to wash her hands from the Nakba of Palestine, and pave the way to remove resolution 194 of 1948, which emphasized the right to return, compensation, restore property, and to establish its legitimacy at the United Nations, and therefore there is no return, and it is devoted to the theft and rape of property, and the deprivation of refugees from compensation, and for this It tries to find alternatives to the work of ""UNRWA"" in any way to gradually remove asylum.
The ""Israeli National Security Studies Institute"" also ignored this fact about the role of the Commission towards Palestinian refugees, when he issued an appreciation of the situation that ""stopping the work of UNRWA is a decent step that requires prior equipment"", and said: ""cutting relations between Israel and UNRWA is a complex event. Its administration is rationally, and it will be the responsibility in the eyes The world on Israel, which will have to be replaced by UNRWA, which will happen in the Gaza Strip, where the Israeli military presence is like the West Bank, as an occupying power is considered responsible for the population, in addition to Jerusalem, where all responsibility rests with Israel.
UNRWA's work, if implemented, would violate international law, the United Nations Constitution and the United Nations Convention approved in 1946. According to the agreement, it is based on the fact that the United Nations considers Gaza and the West Bank Palestinian lands occupied by Israel; International law requires approval of relief programs for those who deserve them, and to facilitate this by all available means.
The agreement also deals with the diplomatic privileges and immunities granted to the United Nations operations, ""and international law confirms that Israel cannot use the national law prohibiting UNRWA, as a justification for not fulfilling its obligations under international law."" Meaning that if there is a conflict between national law and international law, then the second is submitted to the first.
According to the UN resolution issued by the United Nations General Assembly No. 302 dated 8/12/1949, UNRWA was established As a temporary agency concerned with Palestinian refugees as an expression of international political responsibility towards the issue of Palestinian refugees, unlike the High Commissioner for Refugees that express human responsibility towards all refugees in the world, but with the paragraph of the first article ""D"", and what included in the directives of 2017 will take 2.7 million Palestinian refugees. Registered in UNRWA's records (1.7 million in Gaza, and a million in the West Bank, including Jerusalem Eastern), on a new and larger level of international protection than the High Commissioner for Refugees, which is the best solution for it in long -term asylum (more than 7 decades) in the application of the right to return to the homeland.
And not only that, but then Palestinian refugees will obtain their full rights: (legal, humanitarian and physical protection that UNRWA lacks), and the Palestinian refugee will not lose his characteristic as a refugee, but will continue to carry this capacity with his children and grandchildren until the return according to the Justice Law, Just as it happens with the UNRWA agency, the accumulation of data and the memorization of registration for millions of refugees.
Will the magic turn on the magician, and the United Nations will be pressured, and the United Nations will be pressured? To give Palestinian refugees, through the High Commissioner for Refugees, what UNRWA was unable to do after more than 75 years, or is the balance of power to let the Palestinian refugees again?

"In the intense confrontation with the issue of the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, all of us are coordinated; Politicians and media with the American definition of this concept, and we fell into the trap of the trauma narrative, in describing the displacement of the plan or proposal.
We went through a long debate around it and worked hard to refute it as a plan. Rather, we said that facing the displacement plan should be by offering an alternative plan for it.
In justifying the displacement as a plan, its supporters argued that they said in the circles of the American and Israeli decision, that there is no plan presented today on the table other than Trump's plan to displace the Palestinians, and this matter, according to their saying, gives it legitimacy, force of logic and presence.
This context is greatly misleading, it is not necessary to deal with what Trump proposed as a plan, but by naming it as it is in the legal and moral definition, and in international law and the Geneva Convention, a war crime, which may not be dealt with at all.
Displacement is a crime, not a reconstruction plan, and displacement is a work that is totally incompatible with construction, so there is no reconstruction without the people of the land.
Certainly, there is a need for a reconstruction plan for the Gaza Strip, and in this regard it can be on the table with many plans and proposals, which vary in form and style, and the time stages necessary for implementation and material costs, And the like of technical and logistical elements, but there is no one among them stipulating the transfer of the population or their removal from their homes.
The displacement plan as a crime in international law cannot have a place on the table along with the proposed reconstruction plans.
Unfortunately, we are all in the media we have established a normalization relationship with the concept of displacement as a discussion plan, and it is possible to accept it completely like rejection, and this is a dangerous path, which makes the displacement a concept is applicable, and with the passage of time it becomes palatable, but rather acceptable in the absence of ""creative"" alternatives as I claim his companions.
What happened is that the Arab political and media discourse took the English expression ""Option"", which was used to describe the displacement and translate it into Arabic ""option"", so the displacement became a choice like peace, for example, or negotiations.
And every day, Trump added a new detail of the type or seizure of the sector, or the Gaza administration, the option was more ripe in political and media comments, ultimately turning into a plan and a darkest and adopted expression in describing an idea that is actually a crime.
Not only that, but the only plan on the table, and the creative plan that Netanyahu considered a thinking outside the box.
It is true that the majority The overwhelming in the Arab world and in the international community in general rejected it, but everyone dealt with it as a plan, that is, it is subject to discussion and application, if there is no convincing alternative.
It is not important that there is an alternative until we reject the crime, it is sufficient that it is an attack on international law and the human right to reject it by simply putting it, and the rejection is not limited to countries that can be affected by the occurrence of this crime, but rather from all countries of the world that have the duty to defend international law and human and moral values One cannot accept a crime in front of his eyes and standing out, he should intervene to prevent it.
It is possible to quickly review the media approach to coverage, and expressly say that until today there is no plan to rebuild Gaza except to wait for the Arab -backed Egyptian plan, and perhaps other plans from international or Palestinian bodies, while what the American administration presented is the attempt to commit a crime that we must intervene to prevent its occurrence .

"In response to the request of US President Trump, the words of US President Trump violated the displacement of the Palestinians and the call to an Arab -Islamic summit in Cairo on February 27, 2025, estimated at informal circles; A question deserves attention, which is: What are they acting in resistance?

Unfortunately, all words about the achievement of national reconciliation with power and the conquest of ""imprisonment without grinding"" remain. But the official Arab system adheres to maintaining enthusiasm outside the doors of its meetings completely, and the organization's monopoly (Fatah) is the Oslo (Mahmoud Abbas) authority for recognition, representation and attendance. That continuing in this position means taking into account Washington and Tel Aviv Hamas and the entirety of the Palestinian resistance By terrorism. \ N Resistance generally disappears from the data and decisions of the League The occupier, the occupied colonists, their deeds and their allies, by announcing the decision to cut financial support allocated to the families of martyrs and prisoners of resistance to the occupier a few days ago.

The realization of the exploitation of the opponents of the resistance of peoples requires foreign occupation and the injustice of tyranny and the corruption of the monopoly of power and wealth inside is one of the weaknesses of Hamas and the resistance, which was recently exposed strongly, which is the inability to protect civilians from aggression. And its dual challenges between another enforcement project ""Transfers"" For the Palestinian people and remove its resistance, led by Hamas. This is because above all of the above, the Arab official system has been experiencing for decades more weakness and fragility towards external pressures, due to the increasing dependence on the aid and loans of global capitalism led by Washington and its protection. On Trump's request to participate in forced displacement, ""New Transfers"". But is it possible to bet and fully confidently the hardness of this objection? Or prohibiting acceptance of less colonial options than the ""transistor"", but it carries more retreat from the political rights of Palestine, and removes its resistance. \ N in this context, it is not possible to overlook the keenness of major components of the Arab regime to avoid clash with Washington and Tel Aviv, or go with differences To the extent that threatens its stability and existence and raises protection from it, and sacrifices the interests and relationships of business that combines political forces Our social with the wild global capitalism. \ N, and do we ignore the decline in the level of official responses and Arab diplomacy to the war of extermination on Gaza?

In other cases, he did not go out, with the Egyptian regime, for example, from the ceiling of security restrictions and public and in public crises without resorting to weapons, and thank God. . And when the introduction begins with the propaganda media shelling from within the official Arab system against the resistance of the occupation, this requires more thinking and caution. Therefore, American Israeli pressures must be calculated towards a barter deal to postpone a widespread compulsory displacement by removing the resistance. \ N, what are they acting with resistance?

"The nineteenth of January 2025, the Palestinian history will enter the widest doors, on the day the defender was silent, and fighters and enlightenings were absent from the sky of Gaza, the day the Palestinian blood waterfall stopped flowing, and calmed the brutal destruction machine organized for trees, people and stone.
The day the Qassam fighters came out of their trenches and from under the rubble and rubble, in a solemn review of the will, design, organization and strength to meet their popular incubator, for the first time above the surface of the earth, after an absence of 471 days from the days of hell, so the scene was loaded with connotations and messages, and in every direction.
It is one of the days of Palestine, which will not be afflicted by the stray arrows, the struggle of hatred and defeatism, with scratching or distorting.
Those whom our phrases will not be convinced, we advise them, if they wanted to preserve the rest of the credibility and dignity, by examining what is written and broadcast in the media of Israel, and to read well, the faces of its leaders that were absent from the features of superiority, arrogance and arrogance, and to stop at the shaky and defeated discourse that made it from the room Closed, away from the cameras of the journalists and their tongues, the king of Israel And her peacock, who came out stuttering, justified, fabricated, speaks a lot and does not say anything.
image The defeat was drawn on the face of Netanyahu, and in his broken looks.
I was enthusiastic and the Qassam Brigades, and I took from the first minutes of the shot, suitable for resolving the burning controversy in the closed rooms, under the title ""The next day"". As if they wanted to say: We are here, we were here, and we will remain here.
In the face of those who demand Gaza free of enthusiasm and its rule, the battalions slapped them by confirming that Gaza will not rule without enthusiasm, so they will come to a word between us, we go to agreement and agreement, and closing the door in the face of the wind suspicious. History.
In the sophisticated controversy over the concepts of victory and defeat as it was manifested in the agreement to stop the war on the Gaza Strip, its people and its resistance, some rusty voices are rushed, some of which were issued by the bottom of a deep well, from patriots and revolutions, seeking to demonstrate that the resistance has received a heinous defeat, and that the Doha Agreement is not Except for a subtle and surrender instrument, as other pale sounds come out, do not stop practicing rituals Equipment and baccalaureate, She wonders with naive and malicious innocence in most cases: Was it the matter to deserve all the trouble and prices?
Well, gentlemen, we do not know a definition of defeat, clearer than those whose chapters were manifested in Germany and Japan in the conclusion of the Second World War, when the two countries signed a surrender instrument, raised the white flag, decided to walk in the passengers of subordination to the victors, and to open their country to American rules and fleets, and allowed For victorious powers, to decide on their foreign and security policy Defense, including the number of their soldiers, the type of their weapons, and their combat doctrine ... that defeat, which still cast a gloomy and dense shadow over the two large countries.
In the experience of asymmetric wars, in which national liberation movements are involved, in exchange for strong colonial powers, which means defeat, removing the will of resistance, fighting and challenge among the vulnerable peoples.
Defeat means acceptance of the dictates of the enemy and its conditions. As for victory, there is no less than preventing the enemy from achieving the goals of its war and aggression. Resistance triumphs when she prevents victory from her enemy, is defeated if she walked in his passengers, and is required, when repeated like a parrot, his narration and narratives.
Something from this, it did not happen in Gaza, there is no banner White Rifaat, and there is no instrument that was signed. The Palestinian people prevented the legendary steadfastness and steadfastness of the displacement plot, and the first goal of the war fell on Gaza. How remarkable was that we see people in the sum of Gaza, dismantling their tents before the ceasefire came into effect, and their eyes are heading to the north, to Gaza and beyond, and not in the south to Sinai as Netanyahu craved, and he was marketed and justified Plinken in his first tours.
The ceasefire agreement, forcing Netanyahu and the most extreme right -wing government to withdraw from the Strip and stop the war. The ceasefire, as part of a major deal for the exchange of prisoners and detainees, will come out of hundreds of senior leaders and high sentences. The agreement opened the prospects for relief and accommodation, and the road is widely made for reconstruction.
Are these the goals of the war that Netanyahu drew and will bring it with red lines that quickly trampled it with his feet, or rather, its feet were improved by its feet?
What defeat does the people speak, especially those who have one day engaged in the ranks of the Palestinian National Movement? And how this alienation of politicians, writers and ""academics"", is to describe the Philip Habib agreement in Beirut - the invasion and the siege - as a victory that we sing to this day, while the agreement The last Gaza is described as an instrument of surrender and compliance?!
And how do they compare these between the exit of thousands of Palestinian fighters on the ships to the diaspora and expatriates, with French and American protection, as it is a decisive victory, while a handful of family leaders moved abroad, a crime and a precedent that will have what will be after it?!
A fair reading of the war (1982 and the Al -Aqsa Flood) indicates that there is no room for doubt, that the first on its ransom was only a ""short picnic"" compared to the 471 war. Then what about ""the deporters of the Church of the Nativity"" in the second intifada, and for those who looked at the deal that brought them out of their country, as evidence of wisdom and sophistication, while a similar thing is described today, if we assume that it is similar, by being a submission and surrender? With any criteria that read these situations and experiences, and is everything that comes from their team is the right thing, just because they are the owners of the exclusive right in it, and everything that departs from their opponents and competitors is the absolute falsehood.
The resistance did not raise a white banner, and did not receive its weapon, and its people did not arouse it, as many wished, and they waited impatiently for that moment, but rather he went out to chant it, its leaders, martyrs and symbols, and the echo of these chants in the refugee and diaspora camps, and chanted by the sister peoples And a friend.
As for those who sat on the seats of the spectators since the seventh of October 2023, pending the defeat of the resistance, it is their misfortune, that the nineteenth of January 2025 was not one of the days of their Saad Of the ""Guodo Awaits"" type.
The enthusiasm will not take us as we conclude a bloody war chapter, costly and undoubtedly, to lose sight of seeing the challenges and threats awaiting us, including the possibilities of the collapse of the agreement and the return of the specter of war to overlook its bad head to the women of Gaza, its elders and children.
However, we believe that the strength of fragments and payment that came to the agreement is enough to move it into effect, and that Trump, the main engine of the agreement, will be concerned with delivering it to its conclusions. We say this as a matter of weighting, as we are in a region, in front of an enemy, and a president, with them that are difficult for them to confirm and launch final estimates.
Including also, this intense controversy over who will rule Gaza, even though it is a surplus controversy of the need if the Palestinian people are under the leadership, acting out of sense and responsibility of the patriots, and not with narrow personal, factional and partisan accounts, a leadership that looked out our heads by talking about the ""independent decision"", while it is She mortgage itself, power and the Palestinian national project of the continuous adaptation path with the outputs of the Israeli solution.
The required solution is that the ""boycott"" initiate the revival of the Supreme National Reference of the People within the framework of the organization, and the invitation of the unified leadership framework to convene immediately without slowing down, and attempting to translate the Beijing Agreement for Reconciliation, and going to the government of EF Suspicious, and detailed on the sizes of Israeli security theory.
Such a solution, the national, who are prohibited from using relief, accommodation, early recovery and reconstruction, as a means of extortion, and a tool to extract gains in politics and on negotiating tables, Israel and its allies have been unable to achieve it in the battlefields and fields of confrontation .. Such a solution, the national, with distinction, is it The guarantor of translating sovereignty and independent decision, avoiding loyalty abroad, and filling gaps from which you may infiltrate Filter and normalization projects.
But it is an impossible solution until further notice, so the way of reconciliation has become blocked, and it may have reached the point of no return. Therefore, the solution to which initiatives and initiatives, from Arabs and internationals, must be devoted to the equation of their limit The first, there is no return to the rule of Hamas, as it was on the sixth of October, and this is what Hamas accepted before, and you will accept it from a distance, while the second limit inherent to the first, and the condition of passing it and facilitating it, according to which the Gaza Strip does not rule without Hamas. Between these two limits, diplomacy will not be executed as a way to reach formulas and understandings, you may notice a role for power in it, but on the basis of delivery, that Hamas in Gaza was found To stay.

"The national and Islamic forces in the Gaza Strip warned that the Palestinian people are facing an existential threat with the escalation of displacement plans, stressing that these projects will not be limited to the Gaza Strip, but will extend to the West Bank in an attempt to liquidate the Palestinian issue.
This came during the urgent and emergency national meeting organized by the Follow -up Committee for the National and Islamic Forces this morning in the Unknown Soldier Square in Gaza City to confront the plans of US President Trump to liquidate the Palestinian issue.
During the conference, which was followed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the national forces called for an urgent meeting for the general secretaries of the Palestinian factions, with the aim of coordinating positions and taking steps to confront the current challenges, stressing that the Palestinian rank unity is a need to confront these risks.
The national and Islamic forces condemned the statements of US President Donald Trump regarding the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, describing it as a declaration of war aimed at uprooting the Palestinians from their land. She emphasized that the Palestinian people, who made sacrifices for decades, will not leave their homeland and will remain rooted in it, and will face any attempts to displace all available means.

We will not abandon the Gaza Strip, nor will we leave our land and our homeland, nor will we accept an alternative homeland. ”Abu Bilal Al -Aklouk renewed his assertion that the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip will remain constant on their land despite all the challenges they face.

"The social contract, that is, the constitution that is compatible with the free citizens and between them and between the state that elects its ruling party through the ballot fund, is one of the achievements of humanity that organized relations on the basis of public consensus and in a way that guarantees rights and duties.
And if the social contract is adopted within the framework of the state and within the principle of the rule of law, separating the powers and respecting public freedoms, as it is a end for everyone's war against everyone and worked to maintain society and preserve the peace between its components, so it is possible to apply this concept to the state of national liberation movements.
The social contract in the state of national liberation movements means the compatibility of parties and factions with different intellectual and political stripes on a political program that constitutes a minimum that is compatible with it, as it means that there is a mechanism to control internal differences or disciplines in an institutional manner so that the dialectic of the difference is preserved in light of unity.
Unity here means the broad national front, which represents all the forces, factions and actors, and which everyone is in its structure.
The Palestine Liberation Organization in the Palestinian situation is the one that represents the broad national front that should be entrusted to everyone In its components.
The regularity of the meetings of its institutions and the management of differences in them in a democratic manner and through dialogue is the feature that was named internal relations within the framework of the organization.
And if Hamas approaches the organization's program through its amended constitution in 2017 has provided the condition of meeting a joint political program, and if the national dialogues, the last of which is the Bijin announcement, emphasized the importance of political partnership within the framework of the organization, we have become in front of common squares that require everyone to integrate into the components of the organization as the legitimate representative The only way is that the road is cut on any other attempts that may be explained that it is aimed at creating an alternative to the organization.
The current situation is sensitive and dangerous, as we are going through an existential challenge for the resistance of displacement and ethnic cleansing, implementing the decisive plan and liquidating the issue, which requires immediate work to arrange the internal house in accordance with the social contract that was compatible with it in Beijing between the national and Islamic factions.
I think that the absence of the social contract or its lack of translation will lead to the creation of a vacuum, which will open the way for more regional and international interventions in the Palestinian arena.
It has become clear that the waiting policy is not useful and that the bet On changes in the American administration is not useful after Trump's plans are shown on deportation and annexation.
Also, the bet on a supportive, supportive and supportive, and supportive of political life in light of the region's keenness on its security, borders and geopolitical interests.  
It has become evident that attempts to search for an alternative to the organization have also failed to recognize Brother Khaled Meshaal, the former Hamas president.
It is important that the Palestinian leadership take this sensitive circumstance to hold an immediate meeting of the general secretaries to implement the Beijing announcement with the aim of arranging the internal house and announcing the rejection of the displacement project and fortifying this with the Arab and international position in solidarity with the rights of our people.
The General Secretariat meeting must be followed by an expanded meeting of the Central Council with the participation of the National All without exception to renew the announcement of the State of Palestine on the borders of June 4 of the year 67 and to demand the world to end the occupation from it, according to Resolution 19/67.
We have to invest the international momentum by recognizing more than 140 countries in the State of Palestine and strengthened by the decision of the International Court of Justice Consulting.
And work on a conversion to the parliament of the temporary state Drafting a constitution for the state and transferring the institutions of power into state institutions as this constitutes one of the paths aimed at thwarting the plans of annexation and displacement.
The decisive entrance to thwart the conspiracies hostile to the rights of our people lies in commitment to a social contract based on consensus and partnership, can we?

"The former Prime Minister of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim, stressed the importance of the emergency Arab summit scheduled for February 27, indicating that it will be different from the previous summits and must come out with a clear Arab position to support the Palestinian people and refuse to displace it.
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim said, in a post on his account with the X platform, “I have already said in a previous tweet on January 18 that there will be after the agreement to a ceasefire in Gaza important developments and positions to be prepared. And here we are witnessing today's claims and hearing statements calling for the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and its conversion to a real estate project that is sold and bought, and also calls for the occupation of more Arab lands. We live it. Therefore, we must confirm that this summit will not be like the previous Arab summits of the reasons that I mentioned in the beginning. Thus, the next summit must come out In a clear Arab statement and position that everyone is committed, in secret and in public, to support the steadfastness of the Palestinian people, and refuse to displace them and take away the remaining land by force, in compliance with the Security Council resolutions, and other international decisions and university initiatives The Arabic that gives the two parties the right to live in peace side by side. ”He pointed out that“ Israel did not agree to peace with the Palestinians and did not try it until it says that it will not last. A position with the Palestinians, if they do not abide by this peace. More Palestinian territories and even Arab lands occupy, and the evidence for this is what he announced towards the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which should be stood with and with its firm and clear position on the Palestinian issue, and the ridiculous suggestion of Netanyahu, who if he thought a little what he said. ”He continued:“ Everyone knows that The Jews took refuge in the Arab and Islamic countries when they were persecuted in various regions of the world and lived with Arabs and Muslims in peace, growing and growing their trade, to If exotic entities on Palestine began to practice injustice to establish the promised state according to the beliefs of some of them and their goals. Netanyahu knows that the homeland of the Palestinian people is its current homeland, And that his country will take place in it one day, but he wants to continue the crisis and war for other reasons we know. Therefore, the Arab position will be at stake, and the Arab countries must go after the summit to the Security Council with a unified and clear position, in which its previous positions based on the decisions of the nations confirm United that gives the right to the Palestinians and the Israelis to live in peace in two adjacent countries. If someone will use veto, let him do, but there must be a clear position in the Security Council, the General Assembly of the United Nations and the Arab League.

"After a century; President Trump is inspired by the Balfour Declaration (1917), pillars of his plan on the future of the Gaza Strip after amending its own, giving his country an unfair right in a land that does not have at the expense of the rights of its legal owners to displace them and involve the ""security"" of the Zionist occupation to prepare for its settlement later. Despite the aging of the years and the different conditions, there is no difference in the content between the ""origin"" and the ""newly new version"", both of them are a colonial project based on the idea of ??exclusion and displacement to rob the Palestinian people's right to their land and homeland, which was approved by international covenants, norms and laws.
However; Trump's plan will not be written, whether by political and economic pressure on the countries of the region, with understanding with them, or the false ""voluntary immigration"" claims, or by the brutal military force that the occupation tried for more than a year and was unable to empty Gaza from its residents and eliminate the Palestinian resistance. As for the obstacles, they are:
First: The steadfastness of the Palestinian people, their adherence to their land and the refusal of its departure, except for its consciousness and complete awareness of the Zionist scheme for displacement. There is ignorance of his will and solid determination and the legendary sacrifices he made throughout the course of the Palestinian cause, and the resistance is rooted in its tissue. Community and its embarrassment in his conscience. Perhaps the scene of the return of thousands of Palestinian displaced people to the northern Gaza Strip, after the ceasefire, despite the massive destruction, embodies the ties of the ties and their identity.
Second: The solidity of the Jordanian position, as well as the Egyptian, refusing to displace the Palestinians from their land. Jordan starts from an official, popular and popular position in support of the rights of the Palestinian people to end the occupation and establish an independent Palestinian state with occupied Jerusalem as its capital. Oman and Cairo realize the consequences of grave displacement by aborting Palestinian national rights, trying to repeat the Gaza scheme in the West Bank, and to prejudice their national security and the stability of the region.
Third: The displacement projects that extended since 1967 failed to uproot the people of the earth from their historical roots, due to the steadfastness of the Palestinian people and the solidity of the resistance. Including, as an indication; The proposal of the Zionist Moshe Dayan immediately after the aggression to include the Gaza Strip and emptying it from its residents, which was re -presented in 1974 under the allegations of ""voluntary displacement"", which is the same current plan of Netanyahu, and similar to the 1987 plan presented by the extremist minister ""Rehavam Zeevi"" (assassinated by the resistance Palestinian in 2001) to deport Palestinians to Arab countries.
Fourth: The Arab and international rejection of the Trump plan and the threat of security and regional stability. It may not be much reliable on the current international variables; In view of Russia's preoccupation with its war with Ukraine, while the European Union is steeped in its internal concerns, and is still taking place in the American astronomy, especially the prominent political of it related to the region. As for China, it always tends to the diplomatic path, due to the fierce technological competition with the United States, under the cover of the trade war between them since March 2018, which affected other citizens, such as the Washington Declaration, in September 2023, on the new road project between India and Europe across the Middle East, In the face of the Chinese ""Belt and Road"" initiative, for the year 2013, and obstructing its course.
Fifth: The dispute between the Republicans and Democrats in the US Congress over the ""Trump Plan"", which can be invested in the Arabian and regional in favor of its frustration. Here I refer to two important issues; The first: Trump deals with proposals as a ""deal"", as he said, he may retract them if he faces obstacles. The second: his preoccupation with addressing many other challenges that resulted from his statements With regard to Panama and the Gulf of Mexico and Greenland, and therefore either the ""Gaza Plan"" is the same as its promises that he launched in its first presidential term, such as turning North Korea into a tourist destination when dismantling its military nuclear project, or that these issues are combined hot foci that may explode at any moment.
This is related to the issue of US attention to the Asian Pacific region, in the context of global competition, by trying to penetrate the background of Russia, represented in the Central Asian region, restricting the policies of the European Union and Japan, and containing the escalating influence of China and controlling one of the most important energy sources towards it.
However, these ""guarantees"" are linked to balanced steps; Achieving Palestinian national unity, the steadfastness of the countries of the region in front of any American pressure, its diversification of its partnerships and the strengthening of its international relations, especially Russia, China and the countries of Europe, and stimulating its diplomatic movement to confront the plan to establish the Zionist expansionary project in Palestine and the region.
As for the Palestinian people, they will remain steadfast, steadfast, rooted in their land and defending their legitimate rights, and will frustrate the displacement plans, and thwart the goals of the Zionist genocide war.

"As soon as the news of the approval of the Netanyahu office approved the start of the second phase of the ceasefire negotiations in Gaza, the name of the political advisor is the most close to Benjamin Netanyahu, Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer. Netanyahu's office announced the delivery of Dermer's responsibility for the leadership of the Israeli negotiating delegation at this stage instead of the Mossad heads, Didi Bernaa, and the Shin Beit Ronin Bar.
This appointment raises many questions about the backgrounds of this choice for this particular character, and excluding the leaders of the security services in return. But for the truth, Netanyahu has hit with this appointment more than one bird with one stone.
Ron Dermer descends from German origin from his father, the lawyer who had been born in New York to a family that migrated in the past to the United States, and of German and Polish origin from his mother’s party, who was born in Palestine during the British Mandate period of immigrant parents from Germany and Poland before World War II, and after the Nakba The Palestinian migrated his mother's entire family to Florida in the United States of America, where his father met his mother and married, then he was born Ron in Florida in 1971, and lived his childhood and youth there.
And study Dermer is in his youth in a strict Jewish religious school in his city, Miami Beach, in which he grew up a fanatic for Israel, which he learned in that school that it is the one who represents the aspirations and hopes of the Jewish people, in a way that he touched to travel to Israel more than once, and studied economics and administration at the University of Pennsylvania, then philosophy and science Politics at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom in 1993, and he headed a Jewish student association in the name of (Khayim) During his study there, it seems that the years of his studies and activity in Oxford was the one that introduced him into the world of Israeli politics, where he was active from Britain in the Israeli -right -wing Israeli (Israel Israel) party that headed him at the time Ntan Shiranski (and this party merged into the Likud party in 2006).
The name Dermer has emerged at that time among the activists in this party, especially in the 1996 elections in Israel, in which Netanyahu won for the first time heading the government, to migrate after his graduation to Israel in 1997 and acquire Israeli citizenship and marry there, and it is said that Shiransky is the one who presented Dermer to Netanyahu in that. Early time from Netanyahu's political career, and therefore Netanyahu's relationship and Dermer are old and accompanying all stages of life Netanyahu in the corridors of Israeli policy, and soon became one of Netanyahu's closest figures, until some are called (Netanyahu's shadow).
This hardline person reached the intolerance of the occupying state to the point that he abdicated without hesitation about his original American nationality in 2005 to be able to hold the position of economic attaché at the Israeli embassy in Washington, which Benjamin Netanyahu nominated him, who was the Minister of Finance in the Ariel Sharon government at the time.
After returning to Israel in 2008, he effectively contributed to the success of Netanyahu's electoral campaign and his obtaining the presidency of the Israeli government in 2009, to be appointed by Netanyahu, his own advisor, and turns into a man of extremely strength and influence, so he was writing Benjamin Netanyahu's speeches, and this made Netanyahu hand him a sensitive file is Position American circles.
Here, his relations with the conservative movement in the United States emerged, where he succeeded in building a wide network of relationships with personalities affiliated with the Republican Party, which will be presented at a later time to President Donald Trump in his first period, where he admired him. Trump, after learning his great role in directing and moving the helm of Israeli policy towards the United States, especially his role in writing the most famous speech of Benjamin Netanyahu to the US Congress during the Obama administration in 2015, which sparked a diplomatic crisis at the time between the Obama administration and Israel after Netanyahu inciting his speech on Not to proceed with Obama's plan to sign the nuclear agreement with Iran, which was fully consistent with The whims of the Republicans, especially Donald Trump.
This entrance made Dermer a key key to Israeli policy in the United States during the Trump era, through his multiple commercial, political and social relations, played a central role in facilitating a number of dangerous projects, led by the Trump administration's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and the transfer of the American embassy to it in general 2017, as well as its recognition of the officially occupied Syrian Golan, and contributed greatly to a contract Abraham's agreements with a number of Arab countries in 2020, which made his presence in Washington a key success for Netanyahu's aspirations.
With the arrival of the second Netanyahu government, Netanyahu decided to hand over the portfolio of the Ministry of Affairs The strategy of his loyal friend Dermer, and this ministry that was established in 2006 during the era of the Ehud Olmert government as a formal ministry to satisfy Avigdor Lieberman, leader of the (Israel Our Home) party, has turned into an important tool in the hands of successive Likud governments, and a hidden soft hand that works on files that appear small but sensitive, such as a file Pursuing members of the International boycott movement against Israel (BDS), and public relations with Civil society institutions and the like.
During the reign of Dermer, this ministry turned into an effective tool in the diplomacy of closed doors and conversations under the table, and it seems that Netanyahu is based on Dermer in this ministry - which was supposed to be marginal - to the extent that Dermer was a permanent seat in the war cab that runs the war on Gaza Since the seventh of October 2023, which Netanyahu has not been providing ministers in ministries Vital centralization, such as the Ministry of National Security, which was headed by Etamar bin Ghafir.
By looking at these facts, the secrets of Netanyahu's choice of Dermer to head the delegation of negotiations in its second articulated phase at the expense of the Mossad and Shane Pitt main expense.
Ventiaho in stage negotiations The first in which the Israeli delegation was headed by the Mossad chief, he found himself forced under the pressure of Trump Stephen's envoy to get off the tree and agree to the deal in its first stage. He hopes that he was appointed by Dermer that he had restored the full control of the negotiation file in its second stage.
The choice of Dermer means that Netanyahu wants to control the keys to negotiations, because Dermer can consider him a copy of Netanyahu, which made the families of Israeli prisoners express their fear of this choice, so Dermar told them in one of the meetings that he would not support any agreement that leads to ending the war without Full elimination of Hamas, in a literal repetition of Netanyahu's words.
On the other hand, Netanyahu with this appointment hopes to get rid of Trump's pressure, where Netanyahu believes that Dermer is a popular figure for Trump, and this is a real matter, so Derham had stated in one of his general meetings that he considered Trump inspiring him to study economics and business administration at the University of Pennsylvania in his youth After reading one of his books on business administration.
His political relations with Trump in his first term were great, as we mentioned above. Hence, Netanyahu believes that the presence of Dermer is at the head The negotiating delegation may contribute to reducing American pressure on it; Because Dermer is a link close to both parties: Netanyahu and Trump.
At the same time, the appointment of Dermer is a basic station within the war stations taking place in the corridors between Netanyahu and the Israeli security services on it, as it considers that the recklessness of Netanyahu may lead to the entire occupation state project to the unknown, and Netanyahu considers that his success in the position of his close man at the head of the negotiating delegation With the blessing of Trump, he makes him win many points in the face of the security services, and that is He succeeded in neutralizing her from the corridors of making the current war decisions, and even made a decision to prevent its leaders from attending the security meetings, which will make it easier for him to get rid of them later without disturbing the American administration, which has always been a close ally of the Israeli security services, and fully trusts in its various estimates.
Fear here is in fact that the appointment of Dermer means that Netanyahu wants to be the same one who leads the negotiations, and he who at the same time does not want her to succeed, and if she succeeds, based on his own vision without harmful concessions, because he trusts Dermer's ability to reduce American pressure With keeping Netanyahu's interest is at the forefront of his interests, especially because of the enthusiasm of Dermer himself of the war.
We should also not forget here that Dermer is the engineer of the first idea that was presented to the forced displacement of the Palestinians from Gaza by land and sea at the beginning of the war, but rather he tried to market the displacement more than once to the Biden administration, and his choice indicates that Netanyahu wants to implement the displacement plan at any cost.
This is the result of the Palestinian negotiator to have double hardness in the second stage of negotiations, whatever the pressures; Because this time he will not face one party, but rather two sides agreed on the plan to impose surrender by force, and to displace it outside the sector permanently and irreversibly.
The Palestinian negotiator must be aware of the dimensions of what Netanyahu wants and his remaining Dermer, or Trump and his partners, and trusts at the same time that he possesses from the papers what makes him able to impose his vision.

"If we want to find solutions, whether political, economic and financial, we will need to look at the Palestinian reality with a realistic eye, and without any emotional verbal decoration, the reality says that the Gaza Strip is destroyed, and it is not suitable for its current reality of life, and the West Bank is cut off, and a settlement, And terrorist terrorism, and a military aggression of the occupation army is still continuing, with the purpose of widespread destruction of the camps and infrastructure In many cities.
In other aspects of life, we have an economy that is reeling, and a continuous financial blockade of the National Authority, and the percentage of poverty in the Gaza Strip, and after 15 months of the genocide war, it reaches 100% and in the West Bank approximately 35%, in politics, we still live in division, and a sector Gaza is separate and controlled by Hamas, and it does not appear to be in the import of announcing the end of the division.
We live in this reality, and there are statements that talk about the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip. On the other hand, the position of the Arab states so far is a solid position on the issue of displacement, and there is a Saudi position linking normalization and the Palestinian state, but concerns remain that pressure will be doubled, and the re -construction is stalled in Gaza, and the reality of the matter is to expect all scenarios.
There The rapid needs of the Palestinian people, and here we do not talk here about reconstruction, but rather about facilitating and running the lives of citizens relatively acceptable by several billion dollars, and these needs are temporary shelter, tents and caravans, field hospitals, medicines, pure water and food, hundreds of electric generators , And other needs.
As for rebuilding, estimates indicate that this process needs at least $ 70 billion and at least two decades until the sector returns as it was, and in the West Bank, while the Israeli war machine continues to destroy, the reconstruction in turn needs aid and support Financial.
We realize that we are urging to money and support urgently, in order to prevent the displacement with its forced and soft aspects, and money as the experiment says will not come without conditions, and therefore what are the acceptable and unacceptable conditions? The pressure on us may be concentrated to be satisfied with this stage in rebuilding and postponing the independent state for upcoming contracts.
In the broader scene, we are not alone. Those simplicity even realistic.
It is clear that many donor countries will require that Hamas not be in the scene, at least in the next few years, and thus disrupt the rebuilding process, and that Netanyahu still insists that the Gaza Strip will not be delivered to the Palestinian National Authority, and the absence of any agreed perception for the next day. It may also be a privilege to note that the war has not ended, that the war is not only with artillery, and that the displacement is still proposed in one way or another, and that the fate of the West Bank is not clear as long as in Israel in an extremist right -wing government in which Smotrich, headed by Netanyahu, is always enthusiastic about annexation projects.
In a more profound look of reality, we turn to the dangers of offering the mini -state, and what leaks that it will include 80% of the Gaza Strip, after Israel retains a security fence at a depth of 700 meters, and 40% of the West Bank only, i.e. an area in its entirety less than four thousand square kilometers of the area of ??Palestine Historical is 27 thousand square kilometers. The Palestinian reality ranges between staying without a long time or accepting reconstruction in exchange for normalization, or with a final solution that remains from 90 to 95% of Palestine in the hands of Israel.
Question: How can you To face this reality with all its challenges?
This cannot be confronted with the old methods, nor the texts or the logic on which the previous internal dialogues took place. On the one hand, it announces the end of the division, and that it explicitly says that it agrees to take over the national authority in the sector, and that it withdraws from its consent from the scene. Temporarily, especially since the responsibility of the sector is not difficult, but is almost impossible, so hardly, with all efforts, the task of rebuilding will succeed. On the other hand, guarantees can be presented to Hamas that it will be a partner in the construction process and it turns from a military body to a political body, and that it will take its representation in all national institutions through a temporary agreement and then through the polls.
The important thing is that everyone realizes that strengthening the national authority and the PLO and not weakening them at this stage is a supreme national interest, because in this process there is no losing party, but everyone will find a place for him in the political system. But what we feel so far is that Hamas still holds its proofs, And the possibility of remaining in the scene in the Strip, and suggesting that it has not been defeated, the danger in this position is that many parties will use Hamas ditching behind its bets to jump on the Palestinian issue, and in fact the ball is national in the Hamas stadium, so will the movement overcome the national interest over its factional interest?",PS
"Rami Tahboub, the Ambassador of the State of Palestine, expressed ""thanks and appreciation in the name of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, to the sisterly state The Kuwaiti who refuses to displace the Palestinian people from their land and homeland under any pretext was.
He said in a press statement that the Palestinian people and the Palestinian leadership will not allow the displacement of the Palestinian people from their lands and sanctities, and that our Palestinian people have clear national targets and will not abandon them: not for the occupation, not to include, not to displacement. We ask all brothers and friends to continue to support us to achieve these goals, which are the shortest path to peace, security and prosperity in the region. ""
Al -Yahya: The world today is facing a moral and human responsibility towards the Palestinian people for 16 minutes.
He added: «We reaffirm that the State of Palestine is the owner of the legal and political jurisdiction in the Gaza Strip and the entire occupied Palestinian territories, And that it is required to be implemented immediately now is to stop the Israeli aggression, the full ceasefire, the full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and a better management to introduce and distribute aid and provide temporary shelter.
Tahboub stressed that ""the government of the State of Palestine is ready to work to complete this task in stages without leaving any citizen to the land of the Strip.""
He said that ""the international community, which announced one voice, has rejected all plans for displacement for our people to support the efforts made by the government of the State of Palestine to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including Al -Quds Al -Sharif.""
He added that the international community is demanding to work to find a comprehensive political solution based on international legitimacy decisions and the Arab peace initiative and achieve full Palestinian membership in the United Nations and implement the two -state solution and embody the independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital on the 1967 lines, and that this is the only solution to achieve security and peace for all In the area.",PS
"What do the parties need more than a war of devastating extermination and plans for displacement in order to reconcile and unite? In order to confront a unified confrontation of the project of the government of extremists led by ""Netanyahu"" and a plan Trump to liquidate the Palestinian issue, by annexation, displacement and resettlement, or so they believe.
A few days ago, the Palestinian invitations returned to hold a comprehensive national dialogue that resulted in reconciliation between the ""Fatah"" and ""Hamas"" movements, with the aim of ending the Palestinian division, which extends since 2007, and achieving the desired national unity, which are similar calls to those that have emerged extensively since the start of the Zionist genocide war Against the Gaza Strip, on October 7, 2023, and resulted in a few orphan meetings between the two parties to the conflict, in Beijing And Cairo, but it ended, as usual, empty -handed, with the exception of the viewing shouting scenes.
""Fatah"" and ""Hamas"" are well aware of, and all the Palestinian forces and factions are the dimensions of the Zionist -American plan ""to solve"" what they claim ""with the problem of the Palestinians"" at the expense of aborting national rights The Palestinian is rooted in the land and history together, and at the expense of neighboring countries, and the security and stability of the region, but the two movements are pasting in hostility with hostility, and refraining from rejecting differences aside in front of the danger of the stage and its thorny challenges.
Without serious efforts from both sides; The deep differences between ""Fatah"" and ""Hamas"" will not go away in the near horizon at least, while the state of Palestinian division and the steps of reconciliation that prevailed before the Gaza war may continue after that, as the division constitutes the most important deep transformations in the structure of Palestinian society, as a result of its consecration of the separation A sharp geographical geographic between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and for two symmetrical discourse that has not been converging yet, one of them calls for settlement Peace be upon the subjugation of the Palestinian issue to the balance of power only, in exchange for another that the resistance line adopts a strategic choice to confront the Zionist occupation and obtain legitimate Palestinian national rights.
It is one of the manifestations of the ""Oslo"" agreement (1993), which formed a decisive turning point in the formation of the Palestinian political field, when moving from the National Liberation Organization field, which is managed and interacts with a liberation movement (multi -party and political organizations), to the field It is managed and arranged and arranged by a self -government authority governed by a number of monasteries, restrictions and unilateral obligations, foremost of which is the abandonment of armed struggle and the adoption of the strategy of negotiation and recognition of the Zionist entity, in exchange for the latter's recognition of the organization without approving it by Palestinian national rights; This created a shift in the Palestinian political system on the basis of authority and opposition, and not on the basis of mere organizations that are consistent, different and united within the organizational framework of the organization representing the organization.
This has created great challenges in the structure of the Palestinian political system, according to the problems of its emergence according to ""Oslo"" and not the culmination of the success of the national project in reaching its goal of establishing an independent Palestinian state, according to the 1967 borders, with occupied Jerusalem as its capital, and resolving the issue of Palestinian refugees, which none of them was implemented even now.
There is no support for the ""Fatah"" and ""Hamas"" movement except the Palestinian national umbrella, as it is the biggest response to the ""Trump plan"", provided that the serious political will to end the division and rebuild national unity, and to develop a unified strategy by the Palestinian Authority by ending security coordination with the occupation authorities, And the line -up alongside the Palestinian people and the resistance together to address the project The expansionist Zionist in occupied Palestine and the region. Other than that; The anti -external and external contraindications will overcome any horizon of reconciliation.

"There is no doubt that the luster of Western modernity blinds the eyes from the hypersensitivity that occurred to the contemporary man with its brilliant ""lights"", in culture, politics and economics, and despite the horror of the fall that resulted from the separation of man from the values ??of goodness and beauty he can from the reality of contemporary life; Because of the chapter on which modernity was founded in the West between politics and religion, between the body and the soul, and between science and morals, which was represented in the two world wars, in colonialism and genocide and ethnicity of the indigenous population in a number of countries, in the Americas, New Zealand, Australia ... etc.
And in the wars that came after the Cold War and are still destroying, not to mention the exploitation of peoples and their capabilities in the interest of the West, the imperialistism of tendency, and according to what the monopolistic capitalism requires, and despite all this, we could not see the declaration of modernity and the fall of their delusions.
In spite of the criticism directed by contemporary philosophy, which arose from postmodern currents in art, architecture, technology, science and ethics, we could not see the depth of postmodern imbalance in its western applications, and we know that it is just a desperate attempt to spread life in the body of dead from origin.
It was The vortex that we found ourselves, especially in the Arab and Islamic world, as a result of the cultural alienation that we have not yet eliminated, and which constitutes one of the manifestations of cultural, intellectual and political dependency, pre -economic, as an EXINE, we are going to revolve without hope to leave alive, according to the Greek legend.
However, the events of the Al -Aqsa flood on October 7, 2023 were the great shock, which dropped from our eyes a deceitful and deceptive lights and modernity, thanks to the media and globalization machine, to renew it, thanks to the orbits of fascination with the luster of consumption in which the contemporary man fell by an active act, leading him in That pleasure, pleasure, and desires, as there is no room for morals, values ??and proverb in them.
Thus, a person became just a machine that is occupied by monopolistic capitalism, by intersecting the levels of instinct in it, including the instinct of violence and murder, and thus triumphed his inherent desire to dump, ownership and tyranny.
The Flood of Al -Aqsa was an emotional and spiritual alert before it was cultural and political for the global community that united in marches and demonstrations, and his voices rejecting injustice and evil in the Middle East formed as a sweeping way to fall with him The masks of falsehood and deception, and the world discovered that there is a people who are still under the yoke of colonialism and the arrival of the arrives, and lives and dies on the day thousands of times, due to an ethnic and ethnic extermination in the history of mankind. After the West was able, through its media and his knowledge, to blind our eyesight, paralyze our insight, and erase Palestine from our collective memory, just as the history of its bloody colonialism has erased and made the victim in us print with the executioner, and even love it.
The world has discovered that the ugliness of killing, displacement and extermination practiced by an expansionist imperial and monopoly entity named Israel is unparalleled compared to the total of what happened in previous wars, starting with the first and second world wars, and before that extermination that Western white race practiced on the Indians in the Americas and the Aprils in Australia, And Maori in New Zealand, and the sum of the Middle Ages wars And religious wars in Europe.
And if the Holocaust exceeded its ugliness with the ugliness of what had already been preceded, it was not limited to burning and killing the Jews, because it included the Jews, Slavs, Roma, people with disabilities, mental illnesses, and crazy people, according to what was required by the tendency of the Aryan sex, although Zionism is a treasure Colonialism and ideological vision taken from Judaism and anti -Semitism is an excuse to nationalize the Holocaust and make it a commercial origin for the Jews and not other victims.
From this commercial origin, Israel has justified its fake right to exist through the barbaric and systematic killing of a defenseless people in the name of modernity and lights, as it is the legitimate representative of modernity in the Middle East, including its claim to defend the lights and Western civilization on behalf of the West against the forces of evil, which is only Resistance in Palestine and the Middle East, because the axis of resistance has become in the American and European Zionist dictionary equivalent Objectively, evil and terrorism.
Thus, the active powers were settled, and the intelligent forces have turned active if we may borrow the concepts of Friedrich Nietzsche who declared the death of the god, victorious for the superman, or the supreme man, who is nothing but the strongest man, and declaring the resumption of modernity its Darwinian biological cycle later, unaware that the death of the god Maintaining human death.
And postmodernism is nothing but the Junior return of tampering and nihilism, which is the return that worshiped the monopolistic capitalist, led by the United States of America in the world, In the Middle East in particular, and the deal of the century in the reformulation of the new Middle East map is only an example of the renewal of the masks of modernity that negates the truth, justice, reason and morals, after it triumphed over the rationality of killing and genocide, which is the rationality And man.
Thus, the modern state, which was established politically in the custom of modernity on human rights, equality and brotherhood, as represented by the light slogans of the French Revolution of 1789, became a state of racial discrimination and cultural-ethnic preference, and the West became the origin of progress, civilization and lights, and it has a sublime moral task represented in the transfer of primitive peoples that are not Only the rest of the world to civilization and progress, is what Zionism has been claiming since its first conference Under the leadership of Herzl in 1897, it is still led by Netanyahu and the whole of the Israeli right to this day.
Perhaps Netanyahu's word in front of the members of the US Congress July 25, 2024, and his speech to the United Nations General Assembly September 27, 2024, for an example of many examples of the speech of the ethnic and civilizational superiority of Israel, the Western representative in the Middle East.
The equality formed The essence of social and cultural in the discourse of modernity has turned into an ethnic centrality represented in Israel, the chosen people of God, and secularism, which benefits the separation of religion from politics, turned into a religious centrality over religions, and above the same politics, and Israel has been founded on an artificial religious identity.
And if the modern state is in the custom of modernity and its lights, a neutral state that has no religion, then Israel is its religion and its political essence is a Jew with a Western recognition and recognition, and in return the identity of cultural resistance turned into a abhorrent religious identity, and Islam turned into terrorism, and the owners of the land and its indigenous people and the legitimacy turned into terrorists and militias that threaten peace Global and Western civilization, and the brothers in humanity turned into a biological scalpel, according to the transformation of race To a separation between the brother and the enemy, so that everyone who falls outside the white race has become an enemy, and it must be killed, displaced, and the permissibility of his land, his money, his width and his family.
We have discovered, as the world, through the Flood of Al -Aqsa and the subsequent events of the inherent and inherent worlds of the Israeli entity, and it establishes the rationality that modernity described as a basis for the system of knowledge, science and civil life on the bureaucracy of the racist distinction between the Jewish ethnicity of Israel It itself, between the Ashkenazi, the Jews of Western Europe, which is the high -end ethnicity that controls the joints of Israel politically, economically and culturally, Svardim, Eastern European Jews, Haridim, Eastern European Jews, Al -Mazeri, Jews of the Maghreb region in North Africa, the Jews of Falasha, the Jews of Ethiopia and neighboring countries .. Etc. from the ethnic formations with which the Israeli bureaucracy turned into A racist discriminatory tendency among the Jews themselves, which is terribly applies to the Arabs of 1948, or the so -called Arabs of Israel, and those at the political level are Israeli citizens.
This bureaucracy, which was founded on abstraction and classification, on the report, has not transformed the interpretation, and to equality before the law into an authoritarian Toliture in an entity claiming to be the only democracy in the Middle East.
On the basis of the absence of a constitution written for this entity, and the religious and economic lobby governed in the internal and external political pattern of Israel, not to mention the government's lack of compliance with the decisions of the Constitutional Court within Israel, and its compliance with international legitimacy resolutions, this entity is far from the modern state that is based as required by modernity that On the separation of powers.
And if rationality in the custom of modernity triumphs for the truth, then rationality in its Western and Israeli manifestations has triumphed over power, then peace is the peace of the powerful, as Benjamin Netinahu said in his speech to the Israeli Knesset on October 30, 2024, which is the same power discourse that is being circulated in The truth since 1948 the date of the birth of the Israeli entity is by an unjust decision by the United Nations, which formed the essence of the speeches of David Ben Gurion and Mushier Sharett, Golda Meir, Isaac Rabin, Manjim Begin, Isaac Shamir, Ehud Park, Ariel Sharon, and Ehud Olmert ... etc. Do not hide the settlement occupation tendency, as long as that Zionism is the basis and the basis of Israel.
Thus, peace became a surrender, and the resistance is terrorism, after Palestine became ""land without a people for a people without land.""
Thus, rationality has turned into a festive glorification of strength and tyranny, which explains the fraudulent work on the Torah and convert it from a literary-religious text into a historical and ideological text that glorifies the power of God's ""chosen"" people The Zionist killing machine is justified for the deadline.
The true concern behind the revolutions of intellectual modernity was to perpetuate the lights and apply them in the daily life of people as a victory for freedom, and from them the slogans of modernity came with the right to self -determination, and in civil, political and cultural freedoms, and they are in its coverage that branched from freedom as a central value in modernity.
However, the Flood of Al -Aqsa and the oppression and deprivation of the Palestinian lived and remained from 1948 to this day according to the geographical strategy of the catastrophe in the expression of Abraham Mellser in his book ""Make anti -Semitism"", where Israel transformed the West Bank and Gaza after their separation into Kibutsat, settlements and Cannes, through the apartheid wall Near the Green Line, as Tel Aviv and other occupied cities turned into the orbits of residential semester The field is among the various formations of the ethnic Jews on the one hand, and the Palestinian Arabs of Israel on the other hand, as freedom for the Israelis settled an objective equivalent to the imprisonment and enslavement of the Palestinians, as the Israeli is free by birth, and the Palestinian is a prisoner of birth, and every demand for freedom by the Palestinian is considered terrorism and rejection of Western Israeli modernity.
Modernity has been founded on Freedom in the West, it has become the medical prescription written by the American and Western doctor for the rest of the world, as long as this rest is sick in the eyes of Western civilization, and if freedom is the essence of man in every time and place, then freedom as required by the Western doctor is not upright except by accepting his prescription for life, Thus, freedom of expression, freedom of belief, freedom of thinking, freedom of travel and mobility, and other liquid freedoms in the time of modernity The questioner with the expression of Segonda Bauman is determined by the Western Doctor Dictionary.
That is why every conformity is required in itself, and every difference is rejected in itself. Therefore, when the peoples of the world, including the West, united itself, a single voice, not the Israeli evil and the ethnic genocide against the Palestinians, the repression machine moved in America, France, Germany, Britain, and other countries that have seen the victory of the truth, not for strength, and the oppressed, not for the oppressor, an attack on the concept of freedom The civilization, as long as Western modernity describes the owners of the terrorists in their resistance and their demand for their right Freedom.
Just as justice and the judiciary were bureaucratic institutions, winning equality before the law, regardless of sex, religion and race, became a flood Al -Aqsa is institutions for restrictions and judicial and criminal follow -up of civilian activists, thinkers and students on charges of anti -Semitism and praise of terrorism, and in that not thinkers in France, Britain and America were not appointed, and the criticism of Christian, Judaism and Israel has become anti -Semitic, and only the Semites were reduced to Judaism, and even inside Israel transformed criticism of advocates Peace and a large number of Jews of the world to Anti -Semitism, and even self -contempt, as the Israeli right likes to describe a number of thinkers who have become a high critics of Israel's Zionist settlement policy from Naoum Chomsky, through Hanna Arnet, Abraham Mellris, Sakhmond Bauman, Babi Ilan and many others who still live harassment even while they are in America and Germany Britain, France ... etc.
The Western regimes not only did that, but all possible harassment of international judicial institutions, whose tasks are to put an end to war and genocide, as is the case of the International Criminal, here is the United States, through a law enacting the House of Representatives, sanctions against the International Criminal Court in response On its issuance of an arrest warrant in Netanyahu's right and Yawaf Gallant on war crimes and genocide that Israel practiced against Palestinians from Gaza residents.
Of course, this matter was not limited to Western regimes, but also included intellectuals and thinkers between parentheses, and just as Hegel won colonialism at the end of the nineteenth century after France occupied Algeria, promising the victory of European lights driven by the desire to spread Western civilization at the expense of weakened people And Renner Forest to Israel, which is Gaza and annihilates it The reel of its father, through a large number of media professionals, journalists and writers involved in the propaganda of the extreme right, and theorists of monopolistic and imperialism capitalism in its new form, where democracy is transferred on the back of the tanks, as it happened in the Middle East.
The liberation of the world from imperialism and monopolistic capitalism inevitably passes through the liberation of Palestine, and the liberation of Palestine inevitably passes through the liberation from the illusions and fake West lights.

"What US President Donald Trump is doing, from economic decisions and measures, affected by many international countries or will be affected by the sake, completely similar to the military war launched by the German German leader Adolf Hitler, on many countries, when he was fighting more than one front at the time One, during the period between 1939 and 1945, and thus suffered a denial defeat.
The decisions and measures taken by President Trump recently and its series is continuing, whether internationally or regional, has become a threat to the security of many countries, and thus the possibility of global security being affected by negatively, very large, and may lead to ""chaos"" .. and these decisions And the procedures would branch towards only two directions, both of which are in my view, benefiting from the Arab countries in The Middle East region in general, and the Palestinian issue in particular.
In the first direction, if Trump insists on his decision regarding the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, which is a form of madness, or impossible, and not implemented, this may be a reason for an Arab union, or at least forming a nucleus of a group of Arab countries, which is feeling dangerous The status around it ... a union whose goal is to confront a new ""catastrophe"", and to stand against it with all the strength and capabilities that it has given, and therefore the Arab peoples may benefit from this union in the future, and in more than one field.
Although the ""displacement"" process is not so easy and simple, there are a Palestinian people who are related to their land, and his branch is fixed in his home Although most of them wish to erase Gaza from the map.
Moreover, the Palestinian issue may gain a new and more momentum Western support, especially since many international countries declare with their loudest voice that they are against any ""displacement"" of the Palestinian people, and even calls for the need to find a just solution to this issue.
In the second direction, if the American president remains adhering to his economic measures, against many international countries, led by: Canada, Colombia, Mexico, China, Denmark and Panama, then this will be a reason for the union of these countries, and whoever wraps them, and may reach the point of launching economic wars against the United States And on more than one side ... and it is known that economic wars would The destruction of states, the starvation of their peoples, and thus control over them and their decisions, especially fateful ones.
This may also be positively due to the Arab region, as just clinging to the economic measures taken by Trump, may occupy major countries, representing the most important economies of the world, with each other, and thus moving away or turning a blind eye to our region and thinking about it, or at least “its good and evil will stop us And if it was for a limited period.
Also, Trump's continued ""his arrogance, arrogance, arrogance and transcendence"", over the peoples and its countries, may lead to ""isolating"" America, at the very least, as was before the year 1918, and it is not unlikely that there will be military confrontations, from which the whole world will be affected by And headed by the United States of America itself.
There may be a ""brake"" of Trump's decisions, and what he intends to do on the ground, whether it was a legal ""brake"", through measures aimed at isolating it, on the pretext that it is not suitable for the presidency of the United States of America, or otherwise by using another way.

"What was said by US President Donald Trump, during his meeting with the Israeli Prime Minister, Netanyahu, was not only devastating and dangerous, but also criminal, as the call to deport the residents of the Gaza Strip has only one meaning, ethnic cleansing that represents a war crime in international law . And when it comes to the destinies of peoples, it is only permissible to name things with their names even if they are issued by the President of the United States.
Trump was explicit, clear, and rude, as he said that he wanted to deport all the inhabitants of Gaza without return, and he wants the United States to take over it, or with more accurate words to loot it, with its gas well of course (estimated at 54 billion dollars), to implement after that Development projects, expected to be Trump and his son -in -law, Kushner, the largest outlet, then sell them to the rich of the world to be ""The New Riviera"" is at the expense of the blood, hopes and properties of the Palestinian people who have been killed by American bombs, and with ethnic cleansing in the first catastrophe, and they now want to allow it again with ethnic cleansing and theft of its land and its properties. And they want the Arab states to pay the expenses of deporting the Palestinians to them, and their housing expenses in new asylum camps yet Difficulty reuniting their families between different countries.
Netanyahu and all his fascist government, during the meeting, almost lost his mind from joy, because the American president adopted his dream, which he failed to achieve by genocide, by deporting all the residents of the Gaza Strip and its ethnic cleansing, but his tongue twisted when Trump heard he says that he would take the Gaza Strip for himself and the United States country. And he will not leave it to Israel, as Netanyahu thought, which he had to adopt the dirty task with completing The destruction of the sector, the war of genocide, the implementation of ethnic cleansing, then handing the spoil to Trump, who may imagine itself the new American Copy who seizes the lands of the West. Perhaps the most insulting things Trump said that he spoke with everyone in this matter, except with the stakeholders, of course, the owners of the land, history and human civilization in the place, the Palestinian people.
The matter is not a joke, and what Trump may not have said is the humor. It is not permissible to believe a single word from American officials attempts to reduce the crime of ethnic cleansing that Trump called, after it has taken place The world is angry, protests and rejection in the Arab, Islamic and global, and of course a Palestinian, and after Trump did not find a single head of state supporting his idea, despite his claim that everyone loved her, except of course Netanyahu and his ruling Job and 76% of the Israelis who confirmed their support for ethnic cleansing again to the Palestinians, the serious fascist transformation in society Israeli. It is not permissible to underestimate what was said, because, for the first time, at the international level, it is not permissible to support the repetition of the Nakba against the Palestinian people with ethnic cleansing, and an explicit American support for the racist Zionist solution of the existence of the Palestinian people on the land of their historical homeland Palestine.
The dilemma of Israel and the Zionist movement was, and it is still a large part of the Palestinian people remaining on the land of their homeland, despite the Nakba, the occupation, the racial and the genocide. There are 7.3 million Palestinians steadfast on the historic land of Palestine, including the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza Strip, and the occupied 1948 lands, compared to 7.1 million Jews. Despite the approval of the Palestinian official leadership on the idea of ??a two -state solution that gives the Palestinians only 22% of the land Which was used to grant international legitimacy to the establishment of Israel, Israel has repeatedly rejected that solution, and continued to build illegal settlement colonies in the West Bank to kill the idea, and Benjamin Netanyahu mocked his political life to destroy that solution and succeeded. The second solution, which is the emergence of one democratic state in which people are equal in rights and duties, and previously adopted by the Palestine Liberation Organization before falling into the trap of ""Oslo"", as it is also rejected by the majority of Israeli society and from its rulers and all its Zionist parties.
And if the two -state solution and the one -state solution are delegates, even if the regime of Abrahid is a racist, then what remains other than deportation and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people, and this is the essence of the current Zionist strategy to deal with the Palestinian demographic dilemma. It is not enough for them that they were abandoned out of Palestine half of its people, and the longer occupation in modern history is not sufficient, and the system of the apartheid and racial discrimination, and the looting of the lands of the Palestinian people, their wealth and waters, is not sufficient, but today they want to end the presence of the Palestinians with ethnic cleansing first for the Gaza Strip, and then to the West Bank, and after That is for the Palestinians of the two residents living in lands 1948. This is what Trump supported specifically, as he denounced international law from its basis, and to the previous supporters of the United States, albeit verbally, the solution of the two countries, the Shiites illegal settlement, called publicly, and on the heads of martyrs to implement the fascist solution, ethnic cleansing, but its supporters, An example of the lawyer of the killers and sex merchants, Durchvich, to remind us of the ethnic cleansing operations that took place before World War II and during it a justification for the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people, forgetting that we live in the twenty -first century, and in the afternoon of World War II, with the presence of the United Nations, international law and human rights laws.
Trump legitimized unless the Zahania dared to justify him, and made himself an ally of the fascist Smotrich and Bin Ghafir, and the fundamentalist Christian current who is hateful to the existence of the Palestinian people, but he forgot that he and Netanyahu are not the only headquarters of what will happen, and that the Palestinian people will resist with all his prejudices a plot to expel him from his homeland, and that the Arab peoples It cannot allow its countries to participate in the crime of ethnic cleansing against the Palestinian people, And that the official Egyptian, Jordanian, and Saudi position boycotted his rejection of this dangerous plan. but Words alone are not enough, and international condemnations are important, but they need a force that supports them.
Not underestimating the next danger and confronting it requires several immediate procedures, which are in order: First: ending the Palestinian internal division and uniting the national ranks with the immediate application of the Beijing agreement, forming a government of national reconciliation, and calling the temporary leadership framework that was approved in 2011 to the convening, and Trump's confront and Israel in a national grade Unified, unified national leadership, and under the dangers The missionaries who were placed in the place of implementation, ethnic cleansing of the invasion and the annexation of the West Bank and its Judaization, there is no longer a justification for any Palestinian leader to disrupt this matter, whatever the excuses. And whoever thinks that, by his departure through national unity, he will improve his chances of the Trump administration, he received the categorical and clear answer, there is no place for the Palestinians in all their directions in the Trump agenda and its administration except to deport them and seize their lands.
Second, it is necessary to invite a new Arab Islamic Summit conference that includes 56 countries to declare a firm, strict and clear position against the Trump plan, and to support the Egyptian and Jordanian positions who refuse to deport the Palestinians, but rather to support these countries materially if Trump threatened to use extortion Financial against it, and the establishment of an immediate financial support network to support the steadfastness of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and to support the reconstruction of Gaza and to confront the obstacles that Israel places.
Third, it is necessary to invite a global conference, or a joint global position against the plot of ethnic cleansing, because the matter is no longer only to protect the Palestinian people, but to protect the idea of ??international law and the global order from the blackness of the law of the jungle, which will make dozens of countries for a boundary bite of every tyrant and system despot.
The plot of ethnic cleansing will not succeed, due to the valor and steadfastness of the Palestinian people, but it will only fail to adopt an approach to its strategic force. Many will be surprised by the speed of Trump's retreat from his dangerous ideas, when he feels strongly (hard) rejection and confrontation, as he, in the end, is a businessman who tries to bullying and intimidating gains, and retreats if his loss is that his losses will exceed his gains.",PS
"To the extent that the records that followed the press conference of His Majesty with US President Donald Trump, and the false conclusions it included, raised our anger as Jordanians, as much as it was an opportunity to emphasize again Jordan's firm position on the Palestinian issue.
Perhaps the most prominent title that presented an unpredictable summary is what was stated in the New York Times in its presidential article entitled ""The King of Jordan will repel the Trump proposal to displace the Palestinians from Gaza."" Where the newspaper clarified in its sub -title the firm position shown by His Majesty in the face of the offering that Trump insists on his adoption, ""His categorical rejection came after President Trump insisted on Tuesday that the United States has power to acquire Gaza."" Of course, we do not need to be martyred with what American newspapers concluded him to confirm Jordan's position towards the extremist offering of President Trump, but the reference to these articles reflects the message The clear and decisive that reached the political corridors in Washington, which is that the displacement is an unprecedented proposal. Three points were explicit and directly by His Majesty the King: The first is the Arab position, Jordan is not alone in the face of this proposition, but there is there A unified Arab consensus, which His Majesty emphasized, by talking about consulting with the Saudi sister, and by repeating it more than once that there is an Egyptian initiative that represents an Arab consensus, which is something that President Trump can ignore in light of the reconciliation policies he pursues. Second, the scope in which Jordan is moving towards our people in the Gaza Strip, which is to extend help to them and provide everything that is possible to ensure that they remain in their homeland and on their land. Perhaps the initiative to treat two patients with cancer in the sector is only a compelling indication of this proposal that integrates with What the field hospitals do day and night in the sector, this is at a time when the sector today is free from any ingredients to provide the minimum required care. For these patients, who ask God for them and other patients a speedy recovery.
As for the third issue that His Majesty affirmed during his meeting with President Trump and the American political leaders, it is the Supreme Jordanian interest, which constitutes the basic premise of Jordanian policies and in how they deal with external proposals and agendas, a interest that completely intersects with the unified Arab position, which was confirmed by ""New York Times ""when she mentioned that His Majesty The king has ""repelled"" any attempt by Trump to separate Jordan from the unified Arab position, or pushed it towards policies that contradict its supreme national interests, or bargaining its role in alleviating the suffering of the Palestinian people. It is not the ""New York Times"" alone that concluded to the firm Jordanian position towards proposals Trump, even the majority of American newspapers, including those close to the American President himself, have reached the same result, which is The conclusion and the clear message that arrived without the trouble of the conclusion of the American decision -makers at their various levels and party affiliations. All that happened during the past two days confirms that the tactical proposals cannot face the established strategic strategic hardness, and it is also an affirmation that our constants are the same, king and people.",JO

"The Israeli occupation army continues its aggression against Tulkarm and Jenin, amid the destruction of infrastructure and property.

** Tulkarm **
The Israeli occupation continues its aggression, on the city of Tulkarm and its camp for the 22nd day in a row, and the ninth day of Nur Shams camp, amid a military escalation accompanied by the widespread destruction of the infrastructure and the demolition of homes.

Local sources said that the occupation forces pushed additional military reinforcements from the mechanisms and pedestrian soldiers, to the city and its camps, amid a heavy spread of them in Nablus Street, which connects the Tulkarm and Nour Shams camps coinciding with its seizure of two houses in the aforementioned street, and transferring them to a military barrack.

According to eyewitnesses, she added that the occupation army last night carried out a massive raid for homes in Tulkarm camp, and searched them and sabotaged its contents, and subjected its residents who remained in their homes to the field investigation.

The infantry soldiers also spread with the density of the camp lanes around it for military barracks, and a number of them were stationed in the Al -Hadida neighborhood, amid the firing of live bullets randomly, and light bombs, while the occupation bulldozers destroyed the infrastructure in the square of the square in the camp, which was surrounded by the rubble in all His roads and lanes.

Meanwhile, the occupation forces continued their blockade applied to Nour Shams camp, which is witnessing a serious military escalation, as the occupation bulldozers continued to demolish homes, and to cause significant damage to infrastructure and property, accompanied by the firing of live bullets and hearing of explosions.

The extensive parts of the roads in the suburb of Sanaba, east of the city, also included the vicinity of the martyrs cemetery, near the old mosque, in addition to the destruction of the martyrs monument and the severe damage to the infrastructure.

At the same time, the occupation forces continue to close the gate of the Jabara checkpoint at the southern entrance to the city of Tulkarm for the tenth day in a row, and isolate the city from the villages and towns of the Kafriya, and the rest of the West Bank governorates.

The Israeli occupation continues its aggression against the city of Jenin and its camp for the twenty -eighth consecutive day, leaving 25 martyrs and dozens of injuries. Wide destruction in infrastructure and property.

According to local sources, the occupation bulldozers began to split new streets in Jenin camp, an extension from Mahyoub Street to the Joura Al -Dahab neighborhood, and from the west of the new camp to the neighborhood of Abdullah Azzam, and from the Al -Wahdan neighborhood towards Joura Al -Dahab, in addition to the incision of a road from the mountain area until the middle of the camp And other streets expanded inside the camp.

"Netanyahu's image with his soldiers does not look inside a regular Tulkarm camp homes; As the message he broadcast from one of the streets of the camp is talking about his army's war against the camp and its family. Netanyahu and his army minister are racing to come to the camp for the image, but they also confirmed the right -wing government's directions regarding the West Bank and transferring all the weight of the war to it. You remember those pictures that Netanyahu was keen to take from the houses of Jabalia and Rafah camp and on the beach of Gaza City, as well as those pictures that were fond of his former war minister Gallant between the soldiers destroying Gaza. The story is not a picture of a picture, not just a racing for a review, but rather important messages and indicators about the nature of the next stage.
The idea is that the relationship between Netanyahu's pictures in Gaza and his images at home with a generosity beyond mere symmetry and similarity between two reality. After the painful Gaza experience, it has become common in the media discourse, as in the right -wing political discourse in Israel, referring to the tragedy of Jabalia camp as a model that must be applied in other regions, especially when the West Bank camps are spoken. In many places in the Gaza Strip, they were completely destroyed, such as the Rafah camp, but what happened in Jabalia is something Various, as everything was destroyed almost, and it is correct to say: It was not survived as a street nor a street nor a tree nor a lighting column. Everything was systematically destroyed. The scenes that the army deliberately broadcast during the past months of Jabalia was not spontaneous, and it was not just a review and pride, but rather it is part of the future war and to be aware of the failure of the Palestinians of any reaction or just thinking about continuing the fighting. Everything is compared to what happened in Jabalia, and all Israeli threats remind the Palestinian in Jabalia camp and what happened to him in order to stir the bleak and bleak image of Jabalia camp in the Palestinian consciousness to be deterred. What is meant again is that the experience of Jabalia camp in particular within the generalities of the experiment in Gaza will be transferred to the West Bank, and what happened in Jabalia camp will happen in the Jenin, Tulkarm, Balata, and others. They strengthened the trends of separating the fate of the West Bank from the fate of Gaza. Now, talking about calm in Gaza and perhaps a comprehensive ceasefire for a period of years may reach ten, while the situation in the West Bank is another thing that no one is talking about. This approach began to be dedicated since a war 2014 and the agreement that followed, and after that it became clear that the Gaza wars belong to Gaza alone, and accordingly, Gaza's understandings concern Gaza alone and there is no link between the questioning of the West Bank, annexation and destruction and between Gaza. Remember when Sharon entered Jerusalem in late September 2000, Gaza was burned in the same minute and Arafat was directing the trucks himself to transport the demonstrators from the universities of Gaza to the junction of the martyrs (this is how Arafat called it, and his name returned unfortunately in the speech of the current war to the axis of Natsarim). Gaza is the hand of Israel in the West Bank? Also, we must be careful when we answer yes because Israel has never stopped targeting the West Bank and the continuation of its colonial project there. On the contrary, the occupation crimes there remained continuous In the sense that since 1967, this escalation increases day after day, even at the height of the long -term peace process. However, you should not hesitate to answer greatly to the question; The calm in Gaza gave the green light to Israel to implement what it did in Gaza in the West Bank. Yes, for example, the same scenes are returned It has the displacement of Gaza residents and emptying the area of ??its residents in order for the army to carry out military operations in it. This happened in Jenin camp and then in Tulkarm camp, as happened in Jabalia camp and the beach. The same experience. Now, Israel has a model that works to implement and implement it, and has measurement tools that it can use in order to examine the results. Talking about the displacement in the Israeli awareness is not only about Gaza, but also that what is meant is the expulsion and displacement of the population from the West Bank, and Trump's talk about the displacement of the people of Gaza was accompanied by his talk about the inclusion of the West Bank, so Trump's intentions are to liquidate the Palestinian cause, such as being disposed of From any extra commodity. This is how Trump thinks, and this is how his advisers think. While none of this may happen, but the idea of ??displacement of the Palestinians has become an idea ""that can be talked about"" and Trump and Netanyahu do not want more than that. Once again, the image of Netanyahu among the soldiers in the Tulkarm camp is an official announcement of the course of the next stage that You will not start suddenly, but you will roll gradually and you will find in the disappearance of some to promote it, as you will find in some works an encouragement and justification in the Western media. Notice how to talk about talking about The war in Gaza. Now, Israel guaranteed that things in Gaza are going under control. The prisoners will gradually come out. They do not necessarily come out after a week and the second stage may be delayed, but no one will initiate a great escalation, but rather control and weighted in order to improve the results, such as more caravans, a flour truck or two, and so on, and when a mistake occurs like the body of a Palestinian woman instead of the corpse of an Israeli prisoner The matter is remedied, and it is left to each party to say whatever it wants without affecting this. Things, and it is true that Trump has begun to back down from the idea of ??displacement of Gaza ""oppression"", but the idea of ??displacement of Gaza through other ways is not over, and postponed post -war and the lack of completion of a comprehensive settlement and agreement is only part of this strategy that makes life impossible, and now the role is to get rid of "" The head of the head »which the Palestinian presence constitutes in the West Bank.",PS

"The valiant Palestinian resistance triumphed after the steadfastness that amazed the world for a period of fifteen months, and the Zionist enemy failed to achieve its declared goals: the elimination of Hamas and the liberation of hostages and prisoners.
Facilitated by the blood, this is true. Victory, with the burden of tens of thousands of dead and tens of thousands of injured children, women and non -fighters, this is true. A victory surrounded by thousands of bereaved, widows and orphans, this is true.
A victory that takes destruction and comprehensive ruin, this is true. However, or for that, it is a great victory. This is always the colonial powers in the face of revolutions and liberation movements, so colonialism is always cowardly, and always resorted to revenge on the weakest parties, from civilians and simple people to strike the incubating environment in order to make them narrow the revolution and the revolutionaries and change its welcoming position with the revolution and supporting it, while the revolutionaries target the colonial soldiers and its police and camps And his mechanisms and agents.
The most prominent example of this colonial approach is what the Zionist enemy entity did in Gaza. Perhaps, except for the heinous crime that America carried out in Japan, by throwing two nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagazaki in 1945, it is considered Unprecedented Zionist Zionist practices. Complete neighborhoods and camps were destroyed, bombed the tents of the displaced and hospitals, arrested the doctors, targeted journalists, prevented the medical ambulance teams from reaching the victims, and cut off electricity and water, and the work of genocide and crimes against humanity associated, yet the Palestinians resurrected resistance and people. The Palestinian resistance was not fighting the Israeli aggression army alone; Rather, it was resisting several Western colonial countries, led by America and Britain, which supported the aggression with weapons, money and intelligence.
So, the victory of Palestine is a victory for the free all over the planet. A victory for all humanity. A victory for students who carried out courageous protest movements in American universities is funny to their scientific future, and the masses that went to the streets in several Western countries in denunciation of the horrific actions carried out by the usurping Zionist entity against the Palestinians in Gaza. A victory for writers, writers, thinkers, journalists and artists who supported the Palestinian people loudly, including those who lost their functions in exchange for this noble humanitarian position. A victory for the factions of the Arab Resistance Axis, Especially in Lebanon and Yemen, which stood with a solid determination in support of the struggle of the Palestinian people against freedom.",LY

Muhammad Abdul Rahman, who lost his brother in the last bombing, saw that Trump's statements are not just words, but an extension of an ancient American policy that supports the occupation with all its power, “Israel does not fight Hamas as they claim ...

"Human history has not seen the accumulation of wealth in this unfair way in the hands of a few individuals, and he had never seen a wealth that turns into a weapon capable of turning the global regime upside down.
Through cinematic films, the American President's Oval Chamber is no longer a strange scene of our minds, but Elon's vision in it, with his distinctive hat, and his riotous son hanging from his neck, and his unofficial clothes, make him the most exciting symbol in this scene.
When the USAID Agency (USAID), the government institution that has always distributed aid and funds around the world, was closed to the press in a sarcastic and arrogant tone to confirm that its closure was a correct decision. While his son X (noticed the name!) President Trump is joking with, saying: ""You are not the president, you should leave,"" Trump only found to smile a costly smile while signing the agency closing decree.
At that moment, Musk had a wealth that exceeds the total of one billion people around the world. His view was clearly revealing that he considered cutting humanitarian aid, including those intended to combat AIDS in Africa, is an ""economic achievement"" for his country.
But the irony is that this The closed institution cost the US government only $ 65 billion annually, less than 1 % of the state budget, and even less than the wealth of Mask himself.
When the New York Times published reports criticizing the decision, confirming that millions of children will face destruction because of it, the Trump administration dealt with the matter indifferently, considering that the traditional press has become an ""old fashion"" that does not deserve attention.
The collapse of human values
Musk did not look at the agency's work from a human or moral perspective. This question has become the criterion that they measure everything, from NATO membership to the Palestinian issue, and from commercial relations to climate agreements, and even humanitarian aid.
Trump, who made his wealth from trade, surrounded himself with a team of billionaires who adopt the same logic, a cold logic that does not recognize moral values ??and does not know the meaning of sympathy.
With this mentality, they do not see the killing of 50,000 Palestinians in Gaza, a tragedy, but rather an opportunity to turn the coast of the Strip into tourist resorts after the expulsion of two million people from their homes. They believe that financing children's treatment Those with AIDS in Africa ""waste"", just as they see that any project does not make a direct profit for the United States not worthy of existence.
With his assumption of the presidency of the ""Ministry of Government Efficiency"", Musk started his first steps with the closing of (USAID) and the demobilization of thousands of employees, which was only the beginning.
It is not difficult to guess his next step: everything that does not generate money will be closed. For him, this is normal, but rather it is necessary, especially since the circle surrounding it requires more, and urges it to make more harsh and bloody decisions.
Mafia Pay Pal
As Trump's dominance increased, the American media began to focus on the narrow circle surrounding him, which had many names, but the most prominent of which was ""The Paypal Mafia"". This term led the Western press, led by the Guardian, to prepare files and analyzes about this group, and even Wikipedia listed its own page.
This league includes Max Levchain, Keith Rabua, Red Hoffman, Peter Thil, David Sachs, and Eleon Musk. They are brought together by two things: they all previously worked at Paypal, and they all became billionaires thanks to technology. But there is another common denominator: they all support Trump.
These are businessmen who honored them The cruel silicon valley environment, where there is no place for mercy, and where to stay for the strongest. In their world, there is no place for fair competition, but only for the absolute and absolute loser. They managed to stay at the top by crushing competitors without mercy, and now, they are the ones who form American policy. Their first mission was to destroy the traditional bureaucracy, and to destroy the political norms and rules that Washington ruled for decades.
Therefore, it was not strange that some of them described Trump as ""the whip of God"", as it is the tool they would use to implement their dark vision. Mask was not late for moving, as he has already started taking his first steps.
Do you think these technicians will make our lives easier? If you think that, you are wrong. Peter Thil does not believe in democracy, and David Sachs opposes cultural pluralism.
In their vision of the future, stay will only be the smartest and strongest. They believe that survivors in this world are those who have the largest number of smart children, and it is not surprising that the mask of 13 children.
Technology feudalism
In a country that has the largest and strongest economy in the world, these transformations have a global impact. When Trump performed the department as President of the United States, he was standing His aspect of technology giants: Amazon, Facebook and X owners, whose wealth combined exceeded the budgets of all African countries.
These outrageous wealth gave them a feeling that they are out of accountability, just as was the case with the lighthouse princes in Middle Ages, but this time with technology weapons, not swords. They built for themselves that cannot be prejudiced, believing that they are able to reshape the world as they like.
No one dares to challenge Google, YouTube or Instagram, not only because of technical superiority, but because it has absolute political protection. When the European Union tried to impose new organizations on these companies, Trump threatened them, saying: ""We will impose economic sanctions on you.""
Now, these companies provide our data in the Middle East to Israel, to help it kill more innocent people. Can it be trusted to provide any good for humanity?
The desire to end the war between Ukraine and Russia did not stem from their keenness to stop bloodshed, but rather because Ukraine is rich in resources that major technology companies need.
These empires not only target Muslims, but Europe, Canada, Panama, Mexico, and China are all within Her plans.
Perhaps this is the only motivation that will push the world to form an international alliance to confront this unbridled power, and to stop the new princes before they burned the entire world.

"""backstage""; It is the background of the theater or corridor that the actor takes to enter from behind the theater towards the place of acting, and it is also said that the origin of the word scenes belongs to the ancient French word (Coulisse) and the word is used to express what is happening away from the eyes of the spectators, that is, what is going on behind the scenes, which is the preparations of the actors and actresses before Their appearance on stage and the viewers do not see it due to the barriers; It is also said metaphorically for the conversations taking place in conferences and meetings during secret negotiations that are not broadcast on public opinion.
As for the word ""takulis"" and ""the leisure"" in our local accent, I think it is carved from the scenes and carries the same meaning, that is, everything that happens to us in politics, economics and trade is done in secret away from the eyes of people. But it is often in the sense of doing illegal or suspicious actions to achieve personal interests.
And because ""the coding"" is done in secret and away from the eyes of people and in the closed rooms, this hidden and lack of transparency makes people look at the matter with suspicion and apprehension and that what is circulating is a shameful matter or an issue that public opinion is not satisfied with, and therefore ""the leisure"" and ""the coding"" are considered As a behavior that suggests conspiracy, deception and secret agreements The quotas and sees it as a reprehensible matter that contradicts the principle of transparency, integrity and the citizen's right to obtain information.
In the world of politics, secret meetings are common and happening in meetings and conferences naturally before making decisions or recommendations, as it is known as ""side consultations"" between the parties participating in the meeting, and these consultations are often done before the official meeting sessions or the conference to agree on the main items; Before presenting the heads of delegations and announcing this to public opinion.
But due to the loss of confidence between power and people, even if the word side consultations are used, public opinion goes to say that there was a ""olive"" that took place between the parties participating in the meeting or the conference, and this definitely means and indicates a suspicious matter that is automatically convicted, so ""the chole “It includes a negative meaning that suggests conspiracy or betrayal, and the phrase“ side consultations ”will not be used from the negative charge in dismissing people's view of the word ""Al -Kulas"" ... Perhaps the reason for this negative position on ""Takulis"" is the desire of people to ""transparency"", the purpose that public opinion wishes, which is the opposite The information is available and understandable, and future goals are clear, which helps to build confidence and respect between the people of power and public opinion, contrary to what the ""leisure"" does to sow suspicion of intentions and loss of confidence.
In any case, despite the secret and confidentiality in the seizure; It is known for the secret meetings that occur in the world of politics, as it often results in the so -called ""leaks"", which in this context means divulging or intentional disclosure of information that the ""chicken"" people considered a goal in secret, and sometimes some countries allow the release of information Confidentiality after the expiration of a certain time, which helps researchers explain many of the historical events surrounded by ambiguity and was secretive.",LY
"The conversation that carries a defamation of the change that occurred in February has been repeated, due to the chaos, living crises, loss of security, the spread of corruption and other negative phenomena, and I think it is a natural reaction due to the crisis reality, especially if we notice that those who curse the change of change are differentiated Their motives and premises, and do not be disturbed and blamed in these lines for those with emotional alignment of those affiliated with The previous regime ""with their subordination"", perhaps their motives are justified, but naturally, and perhaps perpressing.
Some of them have lost a social status or an utilitarian interest .. Likewise, there is no blame for our simple human being who was raised and bought his cognitive composition from the directed media and the presentation of a pink image of the head of the regime and the greatness of our political system through a fake comparison that was one day marketed under many loose emotional slogans ... and perhaps some of them were a child and did not live the past events, but there is no doubt that many of our countrymen have a good amount From education and knowledge, and they are in my opinion who deserves to go to calm dialogue, perhaps this is in the public interest.
To enter into the heart of the topic, I say: The beginning is that the change in all its circumstances was in my appreciation. Today it has become a reality, and I will not go into its causes, as it is many and most of them are known, especially since that change was accompanied by a movement that included most of the geography of our geographical region in which we live and its conditions are similar to our reality that we lived for for four decades.
Therefore, the right start should have revolve around the question that says: What is the responsibility of each of us for the fate and conditions that we live today? Instead of blame and crying on spilled milk, which will not help, have we made the effort, sacrifices, perseverance and determination to achieve the dream of the hopeful state?
In the early years of change, I noticed that the civil movement was active and was the martyrs and the field of Algeria and in Benghazi and other cities filled with protest stops calling for building a state of law and institutions, and some of our youth were very enthusiastic and sincerity to build a modern civil state, but it seems that we were not ready to make more sacrifices , Especially after those brave raids met with threat, kidnapping and absenteeism, some were motivated by Existential fear until the endowments and protests became numbers not exceeding one hand, and some civil activists went to attempt and some of them went and communicated with International organizations related to marginal issues and have achieved personal gains behind this. As for those who could say about them ""the elite"", they needed silence and their writings dealt with neutral public issues, such as responding and ruminating historical events that guarantee them to be present and do not bring them accountability and punishment.
At a time when the ""intellectual"" duty was not tweeting with a swarm or walking with the common passions and wiping the prevailing thought and the authority of the de facto, and he had to be warned of the prevailing sovereignty of the prevailing mind, and it is assumed that his first concern is the safety of his society, not his safety is so that his community does not go back to his path again .
Change was assumed that the opportunity to open the door to us to overcome the mistakes of the past and make every effort towards building the civilian state desired by all the wise, but unfortunately that did not happen and the path went to another path .. We were supposed to search for answers to many important questions .. What do we want? .. I was hoping that we would address the priority topics instead of dragging our pens to the daily transit events and fans with titles and running behind personal interests in a futile conflict that was its results Painful.
It was more successful to talk about the form of the system of government that we hope, what is the importance of the constitution? What is the role of the tribe? How much The credibility of the loose slogans that have been heard for decades ago? What is the relationship of religion to the state? Is it the duty of the state to be a will on the conscience of people? What is a successful economy instead of the prevailing rentier economy? What is the role of women? Are we really believed to be half of society and its role is a life necessity? How important art is in its various fields of music and plastic arts ... etc.

On the eve of an upcoming meeting with the Jordanian monarch at the White House, US President Donald Trump insists on involving Jordan in his proposal to subjugate the Gaza Strip to the control of the United States, and the displacement of Palestinian population to other countries, including the Kingdom, which Amman rejects.
On Tuesday, February 11, the Republican President will meet with Jordan's King Abdullah II in Washington.
During his reception at the White House, Trump raised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, an unprecedented idea that the United States would control the Gaza Strip with the aim of its reconstruction and economic development, after the deportation of residents in the Strip to Egypt, Jordan and other countries, which was an international denunciation.
The sector was destroyed by the 15 -month war, but it stopped under a ceasefire agreement in which the United States, Qatar and Egypt mediated, and entered into force on January 19 last.
After taking office for a second term, Trump launched a series of statements concerning the Gaza Strip, saying that, through his plan, he wanted to move the Palestinians to ""safer"" places such as Jordan and Egypt, and to turn the Gaza Strip into ""Riviera Middle East"", referring to To make it a tourist resort.

The Kingdom of Jordan - one of the main allies of the United States in the Middle East - hosts about 2.3 million Palestinian refugees registered with UNRWA, according to figures published by the Palestinian Affairs Department at the Jordanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, while estimates indicate to Reuters that the Palestinians constitute more than official numbers.
Al -Rantawi said that the idea is ""a recipe for ruin"", and indicates that ""the United States is ready To sacrifice the interests of its closest Arab allies, in exchange for preserving the interest of the Israeli right.
As for Jordan, ""this is really similar to gambling with Jordan's security, independence and vital interests. This is an existential threat to Jordan,"" according to Al -Rantawi.

It is worth the end
Dr. Hassan Khreisheh, Vice-President of the Palestinian Legislative Council, says that holding an Arab-Gulf summit without a Palestinian presence, whether through authority or Palestinian factions, and the issue of the summit is the internal Palestinian affairs, is incomprehensible and unprecedented.
It is believed that the saying that today's meeting is a fraternal meeting for consultation and not an official meeting, it appears and ""as if it is a justification step for not inviting the Palestinian Authority or any Palestinian representative in This is. It also indicates that things are currently unclear in relation to what the Egyptian proposal demands, which was the focus of today's meeting in Riyadh. It emphasizes the importance of knowing whether the new Arab project, which Egypt adopts, constitutes a confrontation with the Trump project, or is it Extension of the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative.
The Arab Peace Initiative is a peace plan presented by Saudi Arabia during the Arab Summit in Beirut in March 2002. The initiative stipulated that Israel withdrawal from the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including the Syrian Golan until the line of June 4, 1967, and the lands that are not It is still occupied in southern Lebanon.
It also called for a fair solution to the problem of Palestinian refugees agreed upon in accordance with the decision of the United Nations General Assembly No. 194, and to accept the establishment of a sovereign independent Palestinian state on the Palestinian territories occupied since June 4, 1967 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and its capital will be East Jerusalem.
On the other hand, the Arab countries consider the Arab-Israeli conflict ending, and entering into a peace agreement between them and Israel with security for all countries of the region. And the creation of normal relations with Israel within the framework of this comprehensive peace.
Khreisha says that Israel rejected this plan from the beginning, and wonders about the possibility of this same plan successful again after 23 years after its presentation for the first time.
For his part, the writer and researcher in international relations, Dr. Salem Al -Yami, said, in connection with the BBC Arab from Riyadh: “We are not sure that the Palestinian Authority did not invite this meeting. It may have been invited, but it was not ready to attend for a reason What, maybe, according to the conditions of the Palestinian-Palestinian coordination. "" He adds: ""But in my personal estimation, the invitation was directed to her, because it is not possible to discuss the issue of the Palestinian people without a representative.""
He points out that if it is not called from the original, “Perhaps this may happen so that there is a kind of explicit talk about the Palestinian dilemma. There is a Palestinian-Palestinian problem in the first place. The Palestinians are not a single political body, nor a single security body, nor a single military body, There is no body required for a specific solution with the Israeli side. "" He explains this, saying: ""There are different factions that do not have an official status in the system, along with the official National Authority Which has international recognition and implicit or formally, the state of Palestine, at least.
He adds: “Many and different are these factions, including jihadi, including the armed and the military, including the regular, irregular, legal and illegal. The Arab side thinks about it. He notes: ""If the Palestinian side is not invited, this may stem from the unwillingness to embarrass this or that Palestinian side.""
In addition to the Egyptian proposal and responding to the Trump plan, the future of Hamas weapon is one of the most prominent questions on the table. Salem Al -Yami says, ""Everyone knows that one of the problems that led to the seventh of October 2023 and what resulted later, was the Hamas weapon or its presence.""
""Hamas is a large bloc that represents a portion of the Palestinian people, and it has influence and influence, and it tried to present itself as a solution. After the seventh of October 2023, it announced its readiness to negotiate with the American and Israeli sides, provided that a Palestinian state is established sovereignty Complete, and pure rule for the Palestinian people, that is, it wants to present itself as a country. This, in my estimation, represents one of the problems. ""
He explains: ""The American, Israeli and Arab position today, even if the last party does not publicly declare that all these parties are not satisfied with the role of Hamas, and consider it an obstacle to any sparkle of hope or agreement that can be reached.""
He points out that ""the Arab or Egyptian plan that is being talked about now, in addition to the position of the Arab League and some Egyptian officials, indicates that Hamas should have the courage to leave the scene at this stage, because its withdrawal from the scene is currently considered a required matter.""
Reuters news agency quoted Egyptian security sources that the Cairo's proposal includes the formation of a Palestinian committee to rule the Gaza Strip without Hamas's participation, in addition to moving towards a two -state solution. The sources talked to the agency about forcing Hamas to abandon any role in Gaza, with temporary Arab and international forces forming to help the Palestinian Authority in the initial management of the sector.
The Cairo news channel, funded by the Egyptian government, quoted an unnamed Egyptian source, that Hamas will not commit to participating in the management of the Gaza Strip in The next stage, with its commitment to the three stages of the ceasefire agreement with Israel, adding that there are extensive Egyptian contacts to form a temporary committee to supervise the ""relief and reconstruction of the sector"".
Hamas has previously said that it is ready to abandon the Gaza rule of a national committee, but it wants to have a role in choosing its members and will not accept the deployment of any ground forces without its approval.
Sources that spoke to Reuters believe that the plan is sufficient to change Trump's opinion, and can be imposed on Hamas and the Palestinian Authority led by President Mahmoud Abbas.

The researcher Salem Al -Yami says that ""the international system, which may sponsor any agreement, is convinced that Hamas committed a heinous act on October 7, 2023, which is the reason behind this destruction that the region witnessed at the security and political levels, according to its opinion.""
He adds: ""I see that Hamas is part of the solution, through the process of exchanging prisoners, for example, but it is also a basic reason for the problem, as its presence disrupts any upcoming solution, as it represents part of the problem in the internal Palestinian abuse.""
He confirms that ""weapons are one of the main problems, as the Israeli side always says that This weapon, whether it is the weapon of Hamas or Islamic Jihad, represents an existential threat to Israel. ""
He adds: ""The Israelis did not say, for example, that the Egyptian or Jordanian state, and their armies, represent an existential threat to Israel, and the armies of any other country, but they exalt the fears of these organizations outside the authority of the state.""
It refers to ""an important detail also in the issue of arming these organizations,"" which increases the complexity of solutions, which is that they are ""armed and funded by controversial states in the region, such as Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood,"" as he put it.
For his part, Hassan Khreisheh says that the Egyptian proposal, which is currently being discussed, is calling for Hamas to leave the political scene, but Israel, he said, ""calls for the exit of both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority together.""
He considers that Israel ""seeks to disarm the Palestinian resistance and remove its leaders outside the country, as happened in 1982, when they were exiled to Beirut.""
He believes that the desire of the Palestinian Authority to rule Gaza individually will not be easy to implement, as the residents of the Strip may consider that the Palestinian Authority has isolated itself during the war, as if it is not concerned with the Strip or its population, as he put it.
as It indicates that any desire to make Gaza an area subject to an Egyptian administration ""will not be easy or acceptable"" for many. He explains that ""there is recently about the possibility of deploying an Egyptian army on the border, which raises the concerns of some in the sector,"" but he believes that ""the time has missed this type of solution.""
According to Al -Yami, Israel believes that ""Western support for it and its superiority in several fields, including the military field, will subject the weakest parties. But the situation of the Palestinians is different, as they suffer from the robbery, occupation and settlement. With clear borders that guarantee the establishment of their state, I think a lot of things will be resolved. ""
For his part, Khuraisha believes that ""the era of the bargains has started, as Jordan says that it is waiting for the Egyptian plan, and Egypt says that it is waiting for the five-year committee, and the five-year committee went to an Arab summit, and the Arab summit referred the matter to an Arab-Islamic summit. It seems that each party throws the ball into The stadium of the other party, ""as he put it.
He adds that, on the other hand, ""it seems that there is a consensus, especially between Egypt and Jordan, to refuse to displace and reject resettlement."" It is considered that ""this topic needs to be strengthened, This reinforcement must come first from the Palestinian side, as the steadfastness and rejection of the Palestinian people will enhance the Jordanian and Egyptian positions, but this alone is not enough, but a unified official Arab position must be.
But Khreisha expresses his lack of confidence in the viability of the declared Arab positions, as he says: ""We, as Palestinians, are unfortunately afraid of the official Arab position, as our experience with him during the past fifteen months was once.""
""Can we trust them again today?"" Trump's proposal appears to be a new Balfour Declaration or a new Sykes -Picot. Is the Arab group ready or able to face that? ""He added.",UK

"The New York Times indicated on Sunday that the mass displacement carried out by the Israeli occupation forces in the occupied West Bank is the largest since 1967, according to experts who spoke with the newspaper.

The newspaper quoted Maha Nassar, the Palestinian historian at the University of Arizona, saying: ""What makes this moment is unprecedented not only the size of the displacement but also the accompanying speech, which increases in the normalization of the idea of ??permanent forced displacement.""

""This represents a great escalation in the long -term conflict, which threatens to change the political and demographic scene mainly.""

The Israeli occupation army is referred to that at least 55 Palestinians have been killed since the army began its operations in the occupied West Bank last month - which began with a large -scale attack on a fetus and the refugee camp, which is still going on.

According to what a citizen from Tulkarm told the newspaper, ""The Israelis have two goals - first, the pushing of refugees from the northern West Bank towards the central areas, with the aim of erasing the refugee camps completely. The second goal is to eliminate the resistance and weaken the Palestinian Authority's ability to rule."" .

"They surprised Trams, the world, by announcing his intention to convert Sector to a prosperous tourist and economic zone, such as the ""Cote Dazur"" area in southeast France, reiterating the proposal to displace the residents of Gaza into Egypt and Jordan. This came as part of the visit of Netanyahu to Washington.
But most likely, its plan will be difficult to investigate on the ground because the majority of Palestinian officials and leaders of the Arab countries, like Egypt and Jordan, and others, will reject this American proposal.
For his part, Riad Mansour, a Palestinian representative of the United Nations, stated that ""our country is our homeland, and if part of it is destroyed, the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian people chose to return to it, adding:"" I think leaders and people must respect the desire of the Palestinian people. ""
In this dialogue, Muhammad Al -Afandi, a political analyst and professor at the Russian Academy of Science, explains that ""Trump's decision is difficult to implement,"" noting that ""international law prohibits such plans.""

International law does not in any way allow the displacement of Gaza population. There were clear decisions issued several times in the United Nations and the Security Council to require the existence of two states. But the problem is Andald Trambar out of the habit and tries through deals or The so -called temptations and threats by force to reach a deal outside international law without the approval of the countries of the world or perhaps with the approval of some only. But the problem here is that it is the country that is supposed to protect international law that does not respect this law. I mean the United States of America.
Of course, this law serves Israel that it will expand its area and land, on the one hand. On the other hand, the displacement of Gaza residents, in fact, means the introduction of new residents, and they are the settlers. This is in fact the first stage. As for the second stage in Trump's mind, it will be the displacement of the West Bank population. This is the full Israeli plan. Karardonald Trumpi uses the interests of Greater Israel and allows them to obtain the largest number of lands.
The position of the Arab countries and the Security Council is very clear. This plan is fully rejected. But Trump is trying to implement his project using threats or temptations. For this reason, there is no state in the world accepting this matter because the Palestinian issue is in the heart of every Muslim and every Arab. The killing of the Palestinian issue completely will be met with great reluctance from the Arab and Islamic countries. I think Donald Trump's idea is an adventure, but in the same Time raises the ceiling of demands and calls for displacement to reach less results.

Read Audatramb announces his intention to take control of Gaza and turn it into ""Rvira Middle East""

In other words, Trump knows that the displacement process is difficult to implement and will face great opposition from the Security Council and the world, but he tries to raise the ceiling of demands to make more gains.
I am 100 percent sure that Jordan and Egypt will reject Donald Trump's decision even if the temptations are fictional and unimaginable.
Jordan does not want to live the same situation in Lebanon, which received Palestinians and the Palestinian resistance. The countries realize that if they receive the Palestinian resistance, they will be subjected to security problems and turmoil, as it occurred in Lebanon during the civil war. They do not want to repeat the Lebanese scenario. This is not a denial of the Palestinian issue, but for security reasons that Oman and Cairo have security treaties with Israel. So, as a matter of national interest, Egypt and Jordan cannot accept the idea of ??Trump because this may lead to the war of eligibility within these countries.
Of course, Washington will not exert military, but economic pressures. It is possible, for example, to present Trump to Jordan and Egypt Economic advantages and financial aid, especially as Cairo depends a lot in its economy on American financial aid. Trump can use the idea of ??stopping aid to Egypt to press or impose sanctions. Which may lead to the collapse of the entire Egyptian economy.
The same is also for Jordan, for imposing any economic punishment on it will lead to tragedy and internal unrest. The question, then, is any weapon that Donald Trump uses? Is it the economic weapon of temptations or sanctions? Personally, I think Trump will practice the policy of temptations because the allies of Washington, like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, will refuse to practice Egypt and Jordan any kind of pressure.
Also read ""a desperate attempt"" and ""ethnic cleansing"" ... reactions after Trump announced his endeavor to displace the Palestinians and control Gaza

But I believe that the United States of America imposes sanctions on Egypt or Jordan, because its presence in the Middle East depends mainly on the two Arab countries. Perhaps there will be a deal, but it will not be applied on the ground and will remain suspended even after Donald Trump's departure from power.
Russia's position is almost powerless. Moscow She always says that the two -state solution is the best solution. It is also against the idea of ??the displacement of Gaza residents.
For her, any manipulation with a two -state solution, the crisis will be complicated and will make future generations fight and continue to claim their rights. So the fundamental solution for Moscow is to solve the problem of the Palestinian issue and establish two states. Russia also believes that the world needs a new ""Yalta"" to settle in the Middle East, Europe and the world. Russia today is unable to find a solution to the Palestinian issue, or at least influence the important international players because it knows that the idea of ??establishing two countries is not acceptable by Donald Trump or from the Israeli government.
I personally think that the world needs three presidents (the Russian, Chinese and American president) who agree with each other to find the fate of the Palestinian issue and devote the two -state solution, as there is no way to a solution other than that. If Russia is victorious in its war against Ukraine, it can impose a two -state solution for both Palestinians and Israelis.

"On board the presidential plane, during a media briefing for reporters, the US President says that he asked Jordan to deport part of the Palestinians in Gaza to him, in addition to that he will ask the same request from Egypt when he phone the Egyptian president, in the context of his speech on what he called the cleansing of the sector.
The president talked about a million and a half million Palestinians, who must be taken out to purify the region, considering this step to be temporary or long -term.
In terms of analytical, the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Jordan seems impossible, due to the lack of a geographical neighborhood, and perhaps the deepest message addressed to Egypt, as it is the neighboring Gaza neighborhood, and there are old projects from the fifties to displace the people of Gaza towards Sinai, but the message about Jordan is actually related to By repeating the same planning at the level of the people of the West Bank, as it is directly adjacent to Jordan.
This comes at a sensitive timing, as the American Ambassador Amman resigned as belonging to the Democratic Party, her resignation has been accepted, and a Republican ambassador will be appointed soon.
Also, the American context carried a temporary comment on US aid to Jordan, which has been completely paid for 2024, and Jordan may not need cash money from this Aid for the year 2025 until next September, while military aid remains, as the United States also has its interests, in addition to the support of ""USADAD"" support for development projects and civil society institutions in Jordan, and this comment included allies of Washington like Ukraine, which is a file Security sensitive to the Americans.
Managing the position on the Trump plan for displacement needs a political effort, and a diplomatic network of a different kind, through Jordan's Arab and international relations, its direct relationships within Washington, and the most influencing fixed institutions on American foreign policy.
Jordan is overflowing with refugees mainly, and since its foundation until today it receives waves of refugees of all nationalities, and has reached a very difficult stage, where the scarcity of resources, financial budget problems, poverty and unemployment, and it is already pushing towards the return of refugees to their country, not receiving new waves of refugees, adding Until Jordan represents a very sensitive geopolitical site, and any attempt from within forces in Jordan, or forces Regional and international to tamper with the conditions for sustaining this political model will be expensive for everyone in a way that exceeds Jordan as well, especially, with the crises that surround Jordan from all The fronts are under regional tension that does not stop in Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Iran to Yemen.
The displacement plan may target Egypt at the level of Gaza, but it will definitely target Jordan at a later stage in the West Bank, and this means that the closure of the Egyptians to the pressure gate will lead to strategic useful results for Jordan, but the fear that is frequent information about the possibilities of international aid to the decline in the Gaza Strip. With the aim of transforming life in the sector into a double hell in the service of the displacement plan, and depriving Hamas of the tools of power and management, And control the distribution of aid, and this is the most dangerous scenario, that is, the sector closed to those in it after the end of the prisoner exchange deal, and the return to drying the aid, leaving the Gazans to a very difficult fate, and opening a loophole for displacement.
The Israelis went out to welcome the directions of Washington, as former Israeli National Security Minister Etamar bin Ghafir celebrated what the American president proposed, and indicated that when the head of the world's largest force puts Trump this idea himself, it is wise to implement the Israeli government, while the Israeli occupation minister considered the Israeli occupation's finances to implement the Israeli occupation minister The extreme right of Smotrich is the suggestion of the American President Donald Trump moved the residents of the Gaza Strip to Jordan and Egypt is a great idea, and this is an expected reaction to the assumption that the displacement of the Palestinians is easy, and no one will stand in the face of the Palestinians themselves.
In terms of humanity, there does not seem to be a tendency between the Palestinians to get out of Gaza or the West Bank even under the bombing and killing, but we have to pay attention to a point in the basis. Everything, which means that the basic fear is related to the manufacture of more severe repellent and dangerous conditions than we saw during the last stage.

Noman Abed: Trump's insistence on displacement to Egypt and Jordan is a form of ""political bullying"" and American aid is used as a blackmail tool

The controversial statements of US President Donald Trump, in which he insists on displacing the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Egypt and Jordan, continues, in light of his pursuit of economic deals to control the sector and transfer it to an investment project.

A book, political analysts, specialists and university professors confirm in conversations Separate for ""?"", that these invitations were met with a categorical rejection from Cairo and Oman, which have repeatedly confirmed that they are not willing to accept any plans aimed at liquidating the Palestinian issue through forced displacement or redrawing the demographic map of the region.

They point out that Egypt and Jordan refuse to be part of plans aimed at striking their internal stability, stressing the need for regional and international efforts to strengthen fair solutions based on respecting Palestinian national rights, foremost of which is the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in accordance with international legitimacy decisions, and rejecting Trump's plans for displacement Which violates international laws.

Defending Arab constants

The Egyptian writer and political analyst specializing in international and strategic relations, Dr. Amr Hussein, describes the invitations of former US President Donald Trump to displace the residents of the Gaza Strip to Egypt and Jordan as ""provocative"", stressing that the two countries have categorically rejected these calls since the beginning of the Israeli aggression on Gaza, and until now The situation is still fixed, indicating that the Egyptian people played a decisive role in supporting this position rejecting the displacement.

Hussein explains that Trump, through these statements, seeks To cover the failure of the Israeli army to achieve its military goals during the recent aggression on Gaza, which included the return of Israeli prisoners, the elimination of Hamas and the administrative control of the Strip.

Hussein confirms that Trump also wanted to stand with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces accountability calls inside Israel because of his failures.

Hussein stresses that Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi was clear in his rejection of the calls for displacement, noting that Egypt will not be a ""gateway to liquidate the Palestinian issue"", but rather to find a just solution to the Palestinian issue based on a two -state solution.

Amr describes this solution as ""optimal"", despite the rejection of the Israeli extremist right to it, which leads Israel, as he put it, to the ""abyss.""

Hussein says: ""We are facing a historical epic scene in order to defend the Arab constants, the first of which is the question of Palestine,"" stressing that Egypt will remain supportive of the rights of the Palestinian people and will work to thwart any plans aimed at displacing it or liquidating its cause.

A systematic scheme to impose a new reality

The writer and political researcher d. Tamara Haddad that US President Donald Trump's repetition of calls for displacement of Palestinians from The Gaza Strip to Egypt and Jordan comes within the framework of a systematic plan to impose a new reality, noting that these calls aim to pressure the two countries to accept the displacement under the threats of US aid cutting and imposing other sanctions.

Haddad confirms that Trump seeks, through repeating these calls, to send a clear message to Egypt and Jordan that they have to receive the Palestinians, considering that the recent statements of Trump reflect a systematic American policy aimed at reshaping the demographic reality in the Gaza Strip.

Haddad confirms that the first criterion for thwarting this plan is the arrangement of the internal Palestinian house, and the development of a unified political program that addresses the ""next day"" path in Gaza, including the return of the displaced to the northern Gaza Strip as a clear message by rejecting forced displacement.

Haddad warns that the delay in the reconstruction in Gaza, whether by Israel or the United States, will constitute great pressure on the Palestinians, which may lead them to immigration ""voluntarily"" from the Strip due to the lack of hope to improve life conditions.

Haddad notes that forced displacement may become a reality if the Israeli military operations return to Gaza, especially after the meeting of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with Trump.

Haddad pointed out that the visit of the American envoy Steve Wittouf to the Gaza Strip recently, and his statements about the reconstruction according to the Chinese model, confirm that the United States and Israel want to impose harsh conditions on those who want to stay in Gaza, including living in peace, and refusing to claim the right to return, and buy housing units in The towering complexes that Israel, Arab and American companies will be built, and that whoever remains in Gaza will be required Work in specific areas such as agriculture, tourism and technology.

To thwart this plan, Haddad calls for uniting the Palestinian ranks and setting up a unified national political program, while searching for Arab and international support to refuse to displace.

Haddad confirms that Egypt and Jordan will not accept displacement despite the American pressure, because they realize that the exit of the Palestinians to their lands will negatively affect their national security.

Haddad explains that the reception of the Palestinians in Egypt may be used by political Islam movements to destabilize, while in Jordan, where the Palestinians constitute 70% of the population, it may lead to serious demographic and political changes.

Haddad notes that the United States is looking for other alternatives to receive the Palestinians, including Syria, which requires an Arab and international response to this plan.

It calls for strengthening political and legal clash with the international community, especially in the United Nations and the International Court of Justice, to reject forced displacement as a war crime.

Haddad stresses that the only solution to the Palestinian issue lies in finding a just solution based on a two -state solution, considering that any plans to displace or reshape the demographic reality in Gaza will exacerbate the crisis and threaten regional stability.

Dangerous plans exploiting the great destruction in Gaza

The writer and political analyst Khalil Shaheen warns that the American administration led by President Donald Trump is seeking to implement serious plans aimed at displacing the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and reshaping the demographic and economic reality of the sector according to an American-Israeli vision, taking advantage of the tremendous destruction left by the recent Israeli aggression.

Shaheen notes that the expectations that were indicating that Trump made adjustments to the ""deal of the century"" in his second term have been fulfilled, as Trump now relies on the de facto matter imposed by Israel on the ground, especially in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.

Shaheen believes that settlement expansion In the West Bank, including unannounced creeping annexes, it has changed significantly from the nature of the conflict, as Trump announced during his first term that the settlements are ""not illegal"", but rather allowed Israel to include them, stressing that the settlers will not be transferred from any settlement or A settler focus, even those in the areas that were supposed to be part of the Palestinian state.

Regarding the Gaza Strip, Shaheen asserts that the scene has radically changed after the widespread destruction carried out by Israel, which affected the infrastructure, homes, hospitals and vital facilities, which made the sector ""unpopular"".

Shaheen stresses that Trump depends on this factor in formulating his future policies, as he adopts a proposal that calls for the displacement of Gaza population and the reconstruction of the Strip according to a new urban and economic model.

High -rise residential complexes similar to the Chinese model

Shaheen notes that Trump is studying the establishment of tall residential complexes similar to the Chinese model, which includes dozens of floors, to accommodate a large number of Gaza population, with the establishment of economic and tourism projects along the coast.

He pointed out that these plans are linked to the displacement of more than half of the residents of the Strip, Where the economic and investment future of Gaza will be linked to specific areas such as construction, tourism and high technology, which reshapes the demographic and economic reality for the benefit of Israel.

On American pressure, Shaheen confirms that Trump will depend on the ""reconstruction"" weapon to implement his plans, as the money will be withheld from the reconstruction operations in Gaza unless it is linked to his plan.

Shaheen notes that Trump will put pressure on Arab and international countries to prevent them from providing financial support for the reconstruction of Gaza independently, which puts the Palestinians in front of two options: either accepting the plan of displacement, or living in inhumane conditions.

To confront these plans, Shaheen calls to accelerate the reconstruction operations in Gaza, starting with the introduction of heavy mechanisms to remove the rubble and pave the roads, and through the restoration of the affected damaged homes.

Shaheen stresses that Egypt can play a pivotal role in this context, through the use of its experiences in the field of construction and the removal of rubble, with broad Arab and international support.

Shaheen notes that Israel is trying to disrupt the return of life to Gaza, especially in the northern regions, by preventing the entry of mobile homes (Carvanas) and heavy mechanisms, leaving tens of thousands of displaced people without shelter or basic services.

Shaheen stresses that the acceleration of reconstruction will hinder displacement plans and enhance the steadfastness of the Palestinians in their land.
Shaheen calls for a unified Palestinian vision to manage the Gaza Strip and the West Bank in a participatory manner, while strengthening the international movement to present the Palestinian issue in international forums, including the United Nations General Assembly and the International Court of Justice.

Shaheen stresses that facing Trump's policies requires wide Arab and international action, while sending a clear message to the world that the Palestinians are able to manage their affairs and confront the displacement plans.

Trump looks at the Palestinian land as a commodity that can be invested

The professor of political science at Birzeit University, Dr. Saad Nimr, confirms that US President Donald Trump is seeking to pressure Egypt and Jordan with the aim of consolidating the idea of ??displacement of Palestinians, as Trump looks at the Palestinian land is not as a homeland with a historical value and national identity, but rather as a commodity that can be invested completely, Advanced capitalism is also seen as a capable product.

Nimr notes that Trump talked about the establishment of tourism projects in the Gaza Strip As profitable investments, he also focused in his contacts on pressure on Egypt and Jordan without any consideration of the Palestinian position themselves.

Nimer confirms that the Palestinian people are the decisive factor in thwarting these plans, citing the refusal of the Palestinians to leave the northern Gaza Strip despite the massive destruction resulting from the military operations that lasted for more than three months.

Nimer explains that about half a million displaced people returned to their homes as soon as they were allowed, indicating their deep adherence to their land despite suffering and destruction.

Nimr notes that Egypt and Jordan will not be acquies from any American extortion, even in light of the threats to cut financial aid.

Nimer confirms that for Egypt, this issue represents a issue of national security, as it rejects the presence of more than a million Palestinians in Sinai, especially since these people may constitute a popular incubator for the Hamas movement linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, which is something that Cairo strongly rejects.

As for Jordan, Nimr indicates that any approval of such plans will threaten the stability of the internal system in Amman, especially with the power of parties with an Islamic background such as the Muslim Brotherhood.

Nimr believes that Jordan and Egypt's rejection of these plans will be conclusive, Even if this results in economic losses or the escalation of internal crises, because they will not overlook their national security under any circumstance.

Nimr stresses that official statements and positions are not sufficient, but rather there must be an Arab and clear practical rejection of these plans, supported by measures on the ground to face any attempts to impose them.

Standardization of the class and enhancing Arab and international support

The writer and political researcher Dr. Aqel Salah confirms that the Palestinian people, who have withstood the crimes of genocide and starvation, possesses the ability to thwart the plans of US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, stressing the need to unify Palestinian ranks and enhance Arab and international support to confront these plans that threaten the future The Palestinian issue.

Salah notes that the biggest bet in facing the plans for displacement and reshaping the demographic reality in the Gaza Strip falls on the Palestinian people, which has proven their ability to withstand despite the extent of the crimes he was subjected to.
Salah calls for uniting Palestinian efforts by declaring a unified national program that includes all factions, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, in addition to the Palestine Liberation Organization, to support steadfastness The Palestinian people at home and the diaspora.

Salah stresses the importance of moving at the Arab, regional and international levels, as he called on the Palestinian Authority to request an emergency Arab summit to take practical decisions that support the steadfastness of the Palestinian people.

Salah calls for heading to international organizations and human rights institutions to thwart the Trump plan, which contradicts international law and human rights, calling for the condemnation of this plan in public and detailed, while emphasizing the need to find a just solution to the Palestinian issue based on a two -state solution.

Salah notes the importance of forming a joint Palestinian-Arab committee, which includes representatives of the Palestinian Authority, Egypt and Jordan, to coordinate efforts, attitudes and movements at all levels.

Salah asserts that this committee must work to unify the Arab position and push other Arab countries to effectively support the Palestinian issue, including severing ties with the United States and Israel in the event of the continuation of the displacement plans.

Salah notes that the Egyptian and Jordanian positions so far reject the displacement plans, but it warns that the capabilities of the two countries remain limited in the face of American pressure.

Salah calls for strengthening popular support The masses in Egypt and Jordan, as the two countries move on the international scene to protect their sovereignty and reject violations of international law.

Salah confirms that what Trump is doing contradicts the principles of national sovereignty, and that this may reach his accountability and his trial on his violations of international law.

Salah stresses that the actual response to the displacement plans requires Egypt and Jordan to cut diplomatic ties with the United States and Israel, and withdraw their ambassadors from the two countries, as a symbolic and practical step to reject these plans.

Salah confirms that the refusal of the displacement must be supported by practical steps that reflect the seriousness of the Arab position.

Salah warns that the implementation of the displacement plans will have catastrophic consequences for Jordan and Egypt, as it will destabilize political and social stability in the two countries.

Salah calls on the Palestinian people to be aware and collective rejection of these plans, while the Palestinian Authority moves at all levels to end this devastating project.

Salah asserts that cutting ties with the United States, which clearly biases to Israel, as well as withdrawing recognition of the State of Israel and cutting security coordination in implementation of the decisions of the National and Central Councils, must be part of the strategy Palestinian to confront displacement plans.


Converting the Palestinian issue into a humanitarian issue

The writer and political analyst specializing in international relations, Noman Abed, confirms that the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip, which lasted for more than 15 months, is not related to a traditional military operation to confront the Palestinian resistance, but rather is part of a larger plan that aims to change demography and geography in the Strip, and displace the Palestinian people And transform the Palestinian issue from a political issue into a humanitarian issue.

Abed notes that the systematic targeting of civilians and infrastructure in Gaza, including the destruction of hospitals and schools, and the disability of the arrival of humanitarian aid and medicines, confirms that the real goal of the aggression exceeds military purposes.

""What is happening in Gaza is not military operations to confront the resistance, but rather a plan to turn the sector into a difficult, difficult to live in, and to reshape its demography and geography to serve expansion political goals.""

Abed notes that the events of October 7, 2023 were exploited to implement Israeli and American plans targeting the Palestinian issue in general, and the Gaza Strip in particular, indicating that these plans aim to include The West Bank and the Gaza Strip, not to recognize the rights of the Palestinian people, and the displacement of the people of Gaza to other countries.

On the Egyptian and Jordanian position, Abed asserts that Egypt and Jordan were and still categorically reject any attempts to displace the Palestinian people, pointing out that the official statements of the two countries reflect a clear rejection of these plans. However, Abed notes that these positions need practical steps on the ground, including addressing American policies supporting Israel, and dispensing with American aid if necessary.

Abed explains that the American insistence, especially by President Donald Trump, to displace the people of Gaza to Egypt and Jordan, is a form of ""political bullying"", where American aid is used as a blackmail tool.
""Trump, who is struggling to remove immigrants from the United States, is the same one who wants to displace the Palestinian people into other countries. This indicates that the United States only seeks to achieve its interests, without taking into account the rights of peoples or the independence of the states.""

Abed calls Egypt and Jordan to strengthen their internal forehead, strengthen their international relations with other countries, and build regional alliances And international to confront American and Israeli policies.

Abed stresses that heading to international institutions, such as the United Nations and investing international relations of these countries, can pose international pressure on the United States and Israel.

""The stated positions so far from Egypt and Jordan are honorable positions, but they need practical support on the ground. There must be serious steps to confront American brutality and policies, and support the Palestinian people in light of the aggression and ethnic cleansing of it.""",PS

The Ministry also confirmed, in a statement published on its Facebook page, that Egypt's continued support for the steadfastness of the Palestinian people on its land, and its adherence to its legitimate rights in its land and country, and the principles of international law and international humanitarian law, stressing its rejection of any prejudice to these inaccuable rights, both through Settlement or annexation of the land, or by evacuating that land from its owners through Displacement, or encouraging transportation or uprooting Palestinians from their land, whether temporarily or long -term.",UK

Usually, the first leg of the evaluation of the presidents is a hundred days after they took their positions, but with US President Donald Trump, the matter is different due to the speed of his movement and the succession of his decisions issued since the early hours of his entry into the White House on the twentieth of January last.
Trump issued a set of decisions in many areas, most notably foreign policy, security, immigration and economics, and from his early days he has shown his intention to make strategic transformations in American policy in very important files, foremost of which is the Ukraine war, the Gaza war, the situation in the Middle East and global trade policy.
Trump used the executive decisions extensively, as a direct way to enforce his presidential decisions.
The executive is practically a decree issued by the American President in accordance with his constitutional powers as the executive authority directly elected from the American people.
The executive has the power of law, but it is not law because the legislative authority represented by Congress is the one that issues legislation, and sends it to the president to ratify it, turning it into laws, or using the right to take it back to it Congress.
End proposed stories
In the event that the president usually approves, the cameras and the media are usually celebrated to sign the legislation and turn it into a law, as the president appears surrounded by the leaders of Congress and some of them hand over the pen or pens that he uses to sign as a gift for the anniversary.
But Trump began to do this alone when signing the executive decisions, sometimes paving the pens to the members of his administration.
Then the event turns into a press conference in which Trump responds to the questions of the present journalists that extend beyond the issue of the decisions he signs.

The Gaza war was at the forefront of the transformations caused by Trump, as Trump began his intervention before the start of his reign, and played a major role in reaching the ceasefire and release the hostages, as Trump sent his envoy for Middle East affairs and his friend Steve Witfouf to participate in the negotiations even before Trump entered To the White House.
Indeed, this effectively contributed to the arrival of Israel and Hamas to the agreement that the Biden administration did not succeed in reaching, although it tried this for many months.
However, Trump returned to surprise the world with a proposal to displace the Palestinians from Gaza and send them to Jordan and Egypt, as Trump re -repeated that idea, and he did not hesitate to talk about his intention to remove the Palestinians when he hosted the King of Jordan Abdullah II in the White House.
Jordan rejects the idea of ??the Palestinians that rejected and rejects Egypt, while Trump and his supporters say that it provides a new and strong idea in an environment in which initiatives and plans have failed over decades.

It is worth the end
As for Ukraine, Trump has caused a major strategic change and entered into a dispute with the Ukrainian ally.
Trump believes that the war should not have erupted, and that it should stop now, but his aides have made it clear that they believed that the recovery of the lands occupied by Russia in Ukraine is not realistic.
It does not seem that the formula for ending the war satisfies Ukraine or European allies of America, yet Trump is on his way, as his administration with Russia agreed to restore relations and revive bilateral cooperation in a meeting between the foreign ministers of the two countries, which was hosted by Saudi Arabia in a major diplomatic initiative.
Trump believes that Russia is a great global power, and that the continuation of the war in this way puts the world peace In danger, it is always repeated that this war would not have occurred if he had stayed in the presidency.
This is completely opposite to the principle of Biden, which was constantly vowing to support Ukraine, and not to give up Russia, and not allow it to devote its occupation of Ukrainian lands.
Today, US President is determined to stop American support for Ukraine, and without that support it will become difficult for Ukraine to fight its greatest opponent.
Trump also wants Ukraine to agree to an agreement that allows America to invest rare natural minerals in its territory, which is the hesitation of Ukrainian President Zellinski to accept it at the beginning, but this is another path that does not necessarily mean that Trump will change his position on ending the war.

In the field of illegal immigration, the American policy led by Trump has changed strongly towards deporting illegal immigrants and tightening their pursuit procedures.
This was a fundamental election promise that Trump presented to the Americans, and here the Congress approached with the support of some of the opponents of the American Democrats from Trump, who issued a law that allows the administration to use stronger means of accountability for immigrants who commit crimes in America.
And in a very influential file on life Americans, Trump, the well -known businessman Ilon Musk, authorized the review of government agencies, its internal conditions and the spending budgets in it.
To become a mask responsible for a new government apparatus concerned with reforming government work, and subjected a mask to criticize political opponents who say that he is not an expert in government work, and that his policies lack the understanding of the priorities of the American state.
But Musk - with the support of Trump - always states that public debt is enormous, and it is up to 36 trillion dollars, and that government spending must be reduced in order to adjust the scales.
One of the important decisions made by Trump and Makkk in this regard was the decision to freeze the US Agency for International Development, which the Trump administration accuses of wasting taxpayer money.
The most important thing for the ordinary American citizen is that the situation of the economy is not good. The cost of living has increased significantly during the years of Biden's rule, and inflation rates are still high, and this is a issue that Trump needs to achieve achievements in it.
Trump is counting on the success of the initiatives to reduce government spending and to attract foreign investments, especially from Saudi Arabia, which tends to expand its economic relations with America, as Trump will probably seek to ask Saudi Arabia to reduce global oil prices because this will lead to a reduction in fuel prices inside America, which reduces pressure on the rest of the prices in the US local markets.
Trump has also issued a set of decisions to increase customs tariffs on everything that comes to the United States, believing that this will lead to the restoration of the power of the American economy in the field of manufacturing and production, but its critics warn that this may come with a reverse return and lead to an increase in the prices of the people's burden.
As for the aspect that may have greater consequences at the strategic level, it is Trump's Minister of Defense to conduct deductions from the defense budget, which is the largest in the world.
Where America spends almost a trillion dollars annually, and Trump's defense minister has issued an unexpected gesture, orders to conduct a review aimed at gradually reducing military spending over the coming years.
In another corner in the same case, Trump did not rule out a large waste in the Ministry of Defense, which Illon Musk might reveal, and most importantly, when Trump spoke about the two great powers competing to America - Russia and China - he did not rule out a return to a reduction approach Nuclear armament and adopting a policy of EFA opens the door to reducing military spending for all parties.
All of this was part of decisions issued within only one month, and Trump does not seem to stop stopping, or reduce the speed of issuing decisions.",UK
"The Jordan Islamic Action Front Bloc, the opposition, which includes 31 deputies out of 138, announced today, Sunday, the official submission to the presidency of the Council of Dabbab, a draft law prohibiting the displacement of the Palestinian people to Jordan, to stand in the face of external threats and pressure led by the American administration to the Kingdom.
The head of the Islamic Bloc and the Islamic National Bloc, Representative Khamis Attia, and MP Hayel Ayyash, have previously presented similar proposals last week. ""The bloc stands against the displacement and the alternative homeland, and lined up behind the Jordanian monarch, Abdullah II, the components of Jordanian society and all its institutions in the face of the American -Israeli plans to displace the Palestinian people,"" said the head of the Islamic Action Front Bloc, Lawyer Saleh Al -Armouti. It was launched by President Amirbonald Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the displacement of the people of Gaza to Jordan and Egypt Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries, and stressed the importance of uniting the ranks to confront the Zionist project and the American dictates.
Al -Armouti also stressed that ""Jordan is an independent sovereign state and no party is allowed to interfere in its affairs The Interior or prejudice its national rights, ""stressing,"" ""The categorical bloc refused any abdication of the right to return and compensation, and adhere to this sacred right is not negotiable."" For any party or party to present it. He directed the Zionist occupation attempts to expand its control over the region.
The draft law criminalizes displacement and Emiratisation through a set of measures that prevent any individual or party from encouraging or inciting Palestinians to migrate to Jordan, and articles include severe penalties against violators of these provisions, including imprisonment and fines. The project aims mainly to ""protect Jordanian lands from any attempts to settle or threats to"" alternative homeland "", while asserting that Jordan stands alongside the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people in liberation and return to their homeland."" The project dealt with the security threats to Jordan, noting that ""these efforts come within the framework of preserving the security of the Kingdom And its stability, ""noting that any attempt to influence the Palestinian identity or change its reality in Jordan"" is considered a crime of war and a crime against humanity. ""
Among the provisions of the law: “Every individual, authority, government, official, civil institution, or any internal or external party is prohibited to allow, encourage or incite the Palestinian people to migrate to Jordan, whether by saying, acting, writing, media, or by any other means of The means of expression, everyone who violates the provisions of this law is considered a felony that is punishable by imprisonment, fine and insulation from the job.
Special Arab summit in Cairo to discuss facing Trump's plan to displace the people of Gaza
In another context, the bloc announced the submission of a draft law amending the law of electronic crime, to launch public freedoms and stop what it described as ""muzzling mouths"" through the applicable electronic crime law. Al -Armouti explained that ""the electronic crime law in its current form is inconsistent with the political reformist trends in the Kingdom, and limits public freedoms,"" noting that Article Seven of the Jordanian constitution guaranteed freedom of opinion and expression. He stressed that the texts guaranteed by the law contradict these constitutional principles and harm With the essence of human rights. He pointed out that ""the exaggeration of the penalties"" included in the law threatens the basic rights of citizens, noting that the current penalties may turn into revenge tools against the people, which impedes political competition and participation in public life.",UK
"Jordanian politicians and analysts considered that the recent talk of President Princetonald Trump, the people of Gaza's displacement to Jordan as a serious threat, stressing the need for the Jordanian government to realize the seriousness of the next stage and prepare for it and not to rely on the previous alliances, and demanded the government to rely on the unity of the internal class to confront the Israeli danger and the American positions biased at the occupation state.
Trump said today, Sunday, that Jordan and Egypt should receive more Palestinians from Gaza, and indicated that he spoke in this regard with the King, Abdallah Al -Thani, a phone call, yesterday, Saturday, and told him: ""I would like you to receive more, because I look at the Gaza Strip The whole is now in a state of chaos, it is a real chaos. I would like it to receive people. Abdel -Fattah El -Sisi today, Sunday, in this regard.
The head of the Parliamentary Reform Bloc, Saleh Abdul Karim Al -Armouti, told Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed that Trump has no right to present such a proposal. The Jordanian ""considering that this is a blatant, unacceptable intervention and a violation of global peace and stability, and he saw that"" Trump's statements are worrying, and Jordan in all its official and popular institutions is one front, facing threats. We are at the heart of one man to defend Jordan.
""We raised the voice high in the face of Trump in his first presidential session as a parliament, government and popular powers to condemn the deal of the century and thwart its plans,"" he called on Trump in his first presidential session, and he called on the League of Arab States to play its role. He pointed out that the strategic relations between the Jordanian government and the United States were the most stable during the past decades, and the coup in American policy ""evidence of political adolescence and the bias of global Zionism."" Al -Armouti said that the American bases in Jordan pose a direct threat to us in light of the current American policy. He stressed that ""the Jordanian people can The arrest of embers for his dignity and his country's pride, ""and called on the government to file an official complaint with the Security Council, considering that Trump's requests are contrary to Article 9 of the United Nations Charter.
Trump's comments ... ""The worst nightmares""
The political analyst, founder and director general of the Jerusalem Center for Studies, Arab Al -Rantawi, said in an interview with ""Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed"" that Trump's statements about the displacement of the residents of Gaza to Egypt and Jordan ""puts Jordanian diplomacy in front of its worst nightmares. It only targets the rights of the Palestinian people in their land and homeland, but because this plan will lead to prejudice to Jordan's security And its stability, identity and entity as well. "" He pointed out that what was before a project for the extreme right in Israel ""has now become a project for the US administration led by Trump.""
Al -Rantawi pointed out that Trump's statements are not new, recalling the endeavors of the former US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinkin, who toured the spokesman ""on the region with the start of the war on Gaza as a promoter of the displacement project, but it was met with an Egyptian -Jordanian and Arab repulsion and this project was a little bit Al -Rantawi talks about temporary migration for the population Trump talks about a long -term or permanent migration. He considered that what Trump's request is not ""a transitional arrangement for the future of Gaza population, but it is permanent, and the experience says with the Israeli custom that every temporary becomes always and this is what Jordan fears and the Palestinians fear and resist and fear Egypt.""
Al -Rantawi saw that the displacement from Gaza, if it was, will be an experience ""to displace more dangerous than the West Bank, in which case the displacement of Jordan will be, and therefore we are facing features of the 2 -century deal that Trump promises, and we expected since his coming that he would be more assertive with Israel On the issue of the ceasefire, but it is more generous in violating the rights of the Palestinian people to satisfy the government of the extreme right in the enemy's entity. He added: ""We are facing a new chapter. Efforts and energies must be mobilized to frustrate it and drop its goals, and this is not an unique destiny but rather in need of vigilance and mobilization, and we are able to resist the project and frustrate it by relying on a solid, solid and active internal front.""
The spokesman stressed the necessity of issuing a Jordanian and Arab Jordanian statement that rejects the project and declares its circumstances on the rights of the Palestinian people, and the support of Egypt and Jordan, and he saw that it was noticeable. The American position came shortly after the US State Department announced the suspension of foreign aid for a period of 90 days with the exception of Israel and Egypt while Jordan has kept, and this may send a message of pressure from the United States to the Jordanian side, and it may represent a island of the Egyptian side to facilitate this process. ""He pointed out that"" The pressure is not acceptable, and the islands are poisoned in this sense, and everyone must confront firmly this hostile American position towards the Palestinian people and the stability of Jordan and Egypt.
Trump: Jordan and Egypt must receive more residents of Gaza
Intensify the diplomatic movement
In turn, the former head of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Jordanian Parliament, Nidal Al -Taani, said in an interview with Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed that “Trump came with proposals that stopped the war in Gaza, and the goal was the Israeli prisoners in Hamas and not a peace achievement in the region and the region, the peace that states aspire to Arabic is linked to the establishment of the Palestinian state on the borders of June 4, 1967. He added that ""the war on Jenin today came the opposite of what the Palestinians and the region aspire to, especially Jordan, and therefore these American and Israeli policies will have negative repercussions on the stability of the region, Especially in light of the attempt to force the Palestinians to migrate by restricting them.
Al -Taani considered that stopping aid is ""an attempt to press politically on Jordan. During the first term of Trump, long -term assistance was signed, and today the stopping aid comes in an attempt to pressure economically and politically on Jordan, and to face this, Jordan must increase coordination with the Arab countries to take a strong position in facing the president's proposals. American"". He pointed out that ""after the fall of the Bashar al -Assad regime, Israel occupied the sources of water, which may be exploited by Israel to pressure Jordan through compatibility with the United States, and this will have a significant impact on the region.""
He considered that ""Jordan must confront these pressures to intensify the diplomatic movement dependent on the unity of the Jordanian ranks popularly and officially and Arab coordination,"" stressing that Jordan is seeking a political solution in the region based on a two -state solution, and if there is no Arab and international support for the Jordanian position, the results will be difficult, Recalling that Jordan ""was always able to communicate with members of Congress and the House of Representatives from both parties to clarify its demands and explain His positions, and it is possible that these people limit the ambitions and directions that Jordan is targeting and resolving the Palestinian issue at the expense of neighboring countries.",UK
"Axius news website reported on US President Donald Trump as saying that he had spoken to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi regarding the transfer of Palestinian residents from Gaza to Egypt, two days after his call, in a phone call with the King of Jordan, Abdullah II, to ""clearing"" the sector. By deporting his residents to Egypt and Jordan, after which the words of the roles are launched in preventing the displacement between those who see the rejection of Cairo and Oman in principle for the displacement and those who see that they may You are part of this displacement plan, or you may not have to stand up to it, and a statement on the Egyptian Foreign Ministry and a statement to the Jordanian Foreign Minister rejected the displacement, and this, even if it is good in the context of the public weakness that afflicted the Arab regional regime, but it raises several questions. Some of them state that the displacement plan is old renewed, given that the idea of ??resettlement of the Palestinians is the solution to Israel's security, legal and ""moral"" dilemmas as a very old idea, and it returns to the history of the Nakba associated with the establishment of the state itself, that is, about 77 years ago, and that it was also associated with Arab rejection For partition projects and the two -state solution in the early period of the life of this report, by its nature. This was A solution to evading the two -state solution by deporting the problems of Palestinian political, security and economic refugees, away from Israel.
Some of them argue that official Egypt diplomatic and security is aware of the goal of the displacement that is linked to the liquidation of the Palestinian issue, and with it the storm of the two -state solution, in addition to that it is well aware of the danger of the idea of ??Egypt's security, and the disaster that it can cause. While others see that the regime in Egypt is not against displacement in principle, but rather is different in return and some arrangements. Sisi has clearly spoken of security, military and political concerns about the displacement and its consequences, during his meeting in Cairo with the German advisor, Olaf Schultz, at the beginning of the second week From the war, but it made a proposal that does not reject the displacement as a principle, but rather rejects it to the Egyptian lands, sometimes he says that you can displace them to the Negev, In other meetings, Europe suggests a broken presentation.
For those who say that Sisi is against the displacement, tell us what he did permission to stand against this displacement since the beginning of the war except statements and the functional role that has deteriorated a lot.
For those who say that Sisi is against the displacement, tell us what he did permission to stand against this displacement since the beginning of the war The statements and the functional role that deteriorated a lot
Mustafa Al -Fiqi also presented the idea that Egypt will receive the residents of Gaza in Camp or a city with an area of ??14 square kilometers for some financial support, a few billion, whether discounts of debt or new investments, and he continued to promote his idea and release ""Samsung media"", and its emergence is several newspapers, and the discussion began about The idea causes controversy, and the fact is that the idea is not a daughter of the ideas of Al -Fiqi as much as it is in the Israeli press Western and groove these voices.
For those who say that Sisi is against the displacement, tell us what he did permission to stand against this displacement since the beginning of the war except the statements and the functional role that has deteriorated a lot, and his ability to accelerate the end of the war has diminished. Has Egypt officially joined the lawsuit of South Africa? Unfortunately, no. ... Did you submit complaints to the Security Council against Israel's violations of the peace agreement and the 2005 crossings agreement several times by killing soldiers, hacking the airspace and occupying the Salah al -Din axis (Philadelphi)? Unfortunately, no. Have you stopped official economic normalization? Unfortunately, no, there are more than a thousand Egyptian companies that are still within the ""quez"", but some of them argue that their boycott is illogical.
It may be there Warnings from some leaders within the army, foreign affairs and some agencies of the danger of displacement, on the grounds that Egypt does not transform an arena from which resistance is launched against the occupying state, and therefore it is difficult to preserve the peace agreement, which is the only thing that is stable in this miserable region, and this is what Sisi himself expressed in more From an occasion related to displacement. The truth is that the stability of the peace treaty is linked to the stability of the regime.
It was assumed that both Egypt and Jordan were not satisfied with the rhetorical rejection of the displacement, but rather that you work in all ways to confirm the Palestinians on their land.
It was assumed that both Egypt and Jordan were not satisfied with the rhetorical rejection of the displacement, but rather that you work in all ways to confirm the Palestinians on their land.
The accurate follow -up of the path of extermination on Gaza indicates that the idea of ??displacement was a fundamental goal that Israel seeks to achieve, whether by war by turning the sector into an area that is not suitable for living, or trying to reverse its results by other means, whether by its war against the UNRWA). And by her relationship with the new American president, who is no less fascist than Netanyahu, Smotrich and Bin Ghafir in dealing with the issue with supporting settlement and displacement, and he does not surrender easily, and interacts with the voices that criticized the idea of ??resettlement and its dangers with reassurances such as offering the resettlement of the Palestinians in several governorates, instead of focusing them in Sinai And the idea of ??closed productive camps, so that they dissolve within society Al -Masry, and they have no opportunity for the security or political gathering that poses a threat to the regime in Egypt or the entity.
It was assumed that both Egypt and Jordan were not satisfied with the rhetorical rejection of the displacement, but rather that they work in all ways to establish the Palestinians on their land, and the region was more aware of the confirmation of the idea of ??the occupation’s responsibility for the people of Gaza and the West Bank as occupied lands and the idea of ??rejecting the joint administration of some crossings and considering them Egyptian crossings A pure Palestinian or Jordanian Palestinian, even if Hosni Mubarak protested against the Hamas movement administration, the Gaza Strip and its people, but it was It deals with the fait accompli, and there was a smart use of the border tunnels for several purposes, including certainly the idea of ??preserving the sector is a suitable area to live in, and part of the state The Palestinian is within the two -state solution, and as a tribute to the Egyptian influence. Consequently, it was not blessed to ever, neither he nor the Egyptian state agencies during his reign, with a long war that leads to all this destruction, so light wars and quick mediation were. Of course, the deterioration that afflicted the Egyptian state was reflected in all aspects of its international relations and its external policy, unfortunately. However, the fears of the sovereign agencies remain clear and transient of the regulations, and the perception of the danger of the idea of ??displacement, and sometimes reflected on the presidential speeches, but the current economic, social and political crisis allows close -up voices of the authority to respond to the idea or put its logic for discussion from time to time.
Egypt and Jordan and their official and security frameworks must restore accounts, and deal with the issue that President Trump raises with sufficient seriousness
Egypt and Jordan and their official and security frameworks must restore accounts, and deal with the issue that President Trump raises with sufficient seriousness
The Jordanian and Egyptian scholarship remains with them just a very limited rhetoric, if we are talking about the displacement plan that carries existential security and political threats for the two countries, which seems coherent and continued on its way to implementation, Only scenes of the return of hundreds of thousands of southern Gaza Strip are hindered by the north, without a strong Arab and regional action, and even after the two countries searched at the beginning of the war for a collective framework, such as the Arab and Islamic framework at the summit of Riyadh, their position was among the most strange to reject what is more striking It is like a demand to stop exporting oil and gas to the countries supporting the occupying power, expelling its ambassadors, summoning the ambassadors, cutting the relations completely or threatening to do so. After obtaining a fragile collective framework, but it is refusing to displacement, and demands to enter aid in every possible way, the two countries remained unable to introduce sufficient aid to install the Palestinians in the north.
Egypt and Jordan and their official and security frameworks must restore accounts, deal with the issue that President Trump raises with sufficient seriousness, and to find alternatives to dealing with the current economic, social and financing pressures that limit their ability to the movement, we are facing a new American president closer to the global fascist alliance, such as his inauguration scene in celebration With the concentration of global capital and the rise of fascism. This alliance believes that the economy and money will make everything and settle the most important issues in the way that These fascists want it, whether in the Middle East or others.",UK

"The proposal of President American Trammabs imposed the US control of the Gaza Strip and its inhabitants deported international and Arab condemnation.
Trump declared his desire to ""reshape"" the Gaza Strip, which includes more than two million Palestinians, by exerting them temporarily to neighboring countries such as Jordan or Egypt, in preparation for the redevelopment of the sector militarily and economically, and ""converting it into the Middle East Rvira"", as he put it.
The proposal was met with a torrent of reactions denouncing around the world, especially after the American president announced that ""everyone loves"" this plan, ignoring the sharp objection shown by the Palestinians and many Arab and Islamic countries.
The US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, explained that the proposal does not stipulate a ""permanent deportation"", but rather a ""temporary exit"" for the Palestinians, pending the removal of ruins and unexploded bombs in the destroyed sector due to the war, and then the reconstruction of infrastructure, and creating thousands of job opportunities there. Describing this step as ""very generous"", Rubio saw that she had paved the way for long -term stability in the region.
On the other hand, this proposal received severe criticism, as his critics confirm that it contradicts the right of the Palestinians to their land. The door opens to serious violations of international humanitarian law.
Despite the American administration's calls for the reconstruction of Gaza, the White House announced on Wednesday that the United States ""will not fund"" any rebuilding operations in the Strip.
A spokeswoman for the White White Caroline Levitte told reporters that Trump had informed officials that Washington would focus on ""planning and supervising"" no more. She also pointed out that a decision was not taken to deploy American soldiers on the ground in Gaza ""at the present time.""
For his part, UN Secretary -General Antonio Guterres warned, on Wednesday, which he described as ""ethnic cleansing"" if the Gaza control plan has passed and its inhabitants move forward.
Guterres, in a speech before a international committee concerned with the rights of the Palestinians, pointed out that ""the essence of the Palestinian people's exercise of their inappropriate rights lies in their right to live on their land,"" considering that any prejudice to this right violates international law.
In turn, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who arrived in Jordan to meet King Abdullah II, stressed ""a severe rejection of the calls for the seizure of the Gaza Strip and the displacement of Palestinians outside their homeland.""
Likewise, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and the League of Arab States have expressed condemnation It is clear to the American plan.
Riyadh confirmed that it ""will not agree to establish diplomatic relations with Israel"" unless the Palestinian issue is resolved by establishing an independent state whose capital is East Jerusalem, while Abu Dhabi described the proposal as ""completely contrary to international law"", and his rejection of the General Secretariat of the League of Arab States as ""the promotion of the displacement scenario"" rejected Arab and internationally.
On the international level, French President Emmanuel Macron and Egyptian Abdel Fattah El -Sisi warned of the consequences of ""any forced displacement of the Palestinian people in Gaza or the West Bank"", stressing that he will become a ""main destabilization factor.""
The European Union also condemned the plan, recalling that the Gaza Strip is ""an integral part of the future Palestinian state."" Germany considered that the sector is ""belonging to the Palestinians"", while UN officials described the step as ""very surprising"", and involved the possibility of a blatant breach of international law.
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Philipo Grande, considered that the Gaza control project was ""very surprising.""
On the other hand, the right -wing Israeli minister pledged to the Salail Smotrich, on Wednesday, to work to ""finally be buried the dangerous idea"" represented by the establishment of a state Palestinian.
For its part, the Israeli NGO, Trump's plan for the sector as ""crazy"".
As for Amnesty International, ""Amnesty"", it considered that Trump's plan is ""horrific"" and ""illegal"", expressing its concern about the ""inflammatory"" character of the White House's master's statements.
On the ground, Trump's statements ignited anger in Gaza, as many residents of the Strip confirmed their rejection of what they called the ""displacement plan.""
Hatem Azzam from the city of Rafah said: ""The people are rooted in their land,"" while the young Ahmed Al -Minawi, 24, stressed that ""Palestine is not for sale.""
In Israel, the Arab MP Mansour Abbas considered that the implementation of the deportation plan will mean ""war crimes and crimes against humanity"", calling for the search for alternatives that lead to a just solution that establishes reconciliation and peace between the two peoples.
It is clear that the difference towards Trump's US control plan on Gaza is not limited to the position of the Palestinians alone, as international reactions are in the feasibility of the step, amid warnings of the risk of threatening the basic rights of the Palestinian people.
At a time when the Trump administration shows adherence to what it describes as a ""development solution"", the fate of this initiative remains subject to regional balances and international pressure escalating respect Human and legal standards.

Prior to the meeting, there were talk about differences that might be tainted by the one who will be provoking the issue of financing reconstruction in the destroyed sector as a result of the war in Israel and Hamas, but it was important because it reflects an Arab unanimity that is rarely refusing to displace the Palestinians at a moment that provides the proposals to mix the papers in the Middle East.

The total US aid to Jordan until the fiscal year was 2020 approximately 26.4 billion dollars.
American aid to Jordan is more than 40 percent of the total official aid that the Kingdom receives annually.
Washington has suspended its 90 -day foreign aid in order to assess the ""effectiveness and consistency of programs with US foreign policy.""
Trump stated that The United States will not be blinded blindly without returning to its people.
A US State Department spokesman told the BBC that the review and reorganization of foreign aid is ""an ethical necessity.""
The spokesman explained exemptions from the freezing decision, including foreign military financing for Israel and Egypt and emergency food aid.

The American administration was not satisfied with this, but rather almost completely replaced the United States Agency for International Development, which represents the American ""soft power"" abroad, and attached it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The agency manages a budget of $ 42.8 billion, or 42 percent of humanitarian aid distributed all over the world.

In 2023 she provided aid of $ 72 billion
Regarding the possibility of cutting aid from Jordan or reducing it after the three -month period, a US State Department official told the BBC that all foreign aid is undergoing a comprehensive review at the present time to ensure its compatibility with the presidential executive order.
Jordan is one of the four largest beneficiaries in the world from US foreign aid.
The former Jordanian Minister of Planning and International Cooperation, Wissam Al -Rabdi, indicates The BBC indicates that the temporary freezing of Jordanian projects funded by the agency may lead to concrete economic and social repercussions, and its continuation will lead to the loss of jobs in the middle class, thus increasing unemployment.
Al -Ribdi suggested searching for alternative funding sources and new economic strategies to support the affected workers and companies.
Political economy, Zian Zwan, spoke to the BBC, about Jordan's historical dependence on building its economy on foreign aid, including American aid.
Al -Rabdi said that this aid plays an essential role in supporting the Jordanian economy, and contributes to financing infrastructure, education, health and water projects, and helps in stabilizing public finances through budget support, and contributes to creating job opportunities, enhancing the role of the private sector, and supporting institutional reforms.
Zwan has excluded the interruption of this aid due to the nature of the Jordanian -American alliance in economic, political, military and intelligence aspects, since the 1950s.

In the event that American aid is stopped, Al -Ribdah expected a high public budget deficit and the total public debt due to having to borrow to compensate for a shortage Funding.
""The credit ratings of Jordan may also be affected, which may raise the cost of borrowing and the annual value of the debt service.""
Economic analyst Jawad Abbasi told the BBC that the total number of this aid ""is not enormous and is not impossible to compensate it through austerity measures and increase aid from other donor countries.""
The Jordanian treasury incurs a debt estimated at 62.94 billion dollars, and the government expects a financial deficit in its budget for the current year of $ 3.19 billion.
Regarding the possibility of the collapse of the Jordanian economy if American aid is interrupted, Zwan said that those who say this ""are not familiar with the aspects of the Jordanian economy and Jordanian financial and social policies.""
Zwan added that Jordan is able to withstand in the face of more severe and tough crises.
Abbasi notes that the budget structure in Jordan depends on other sources, such as taxes and fees paid by the Jordanian people and companies.
It is 69.6 percent of the total expected revenues in Jordan
The value is more than 10 billion dollars
Zwan sees an opportunity to change Jordanian economic policies in the event that the United States will stop or decrease, and he says: ""Lord Warbed harmful. This will be a strong incentive to go towards self -reliance. ""
""This crisis represents an opportunity to reform and enhance economic independence by improving the efficiency of public spending, pushing economic reforms, and enhancing the role of the private sector,"" says Al -Rabdi.
The former minister called for enhancing cooperation with Arab countries, especially the Gulf and Arab funds, called for financial and investment support, and to expand cooperation with international partners to ensure continued funding for vital projects.

During the past years, Jordan has signed four ""non -binding"" strategic understanding notes with the American side, which organized the support period, the value of financial aid and its exchange aspects.
In 2008, the first memo was signed for a period of five years, to provide increasing levels of aid to Jordan, and to spend $ 360 million annually to the Jordan government over a period of five years, and 300 million dollars annually as military financing.
In 2014, President Barack Obama and Jordanian King Abdullah II agreed to provide annual aid to Jordan with a value of one billion dollars for a period of three years.
In 2018, the third memorandum of understanding was signed during the first period of Trump's reign, and its duration is five Years included the provision of $ 1.275 billion annually as external aid, approximately 6.375 billion dollars.
In 2022, Jordan and the United States signed the Fourth Memorandum of Understanding, and Washington is committed for seven years (2023-2029) to provide Amman with $ 1.45 billion in annual economic and military aid ($ 10.15 billion over a period of seven years).

The Fourth Memorandum of Understanding is 13.7 percent higher annually than the third note, and it has the longest time commitment.
The recent memorandum of understanding is divided into four groups, which is 610 million dollars of economic support funds to support the Jordanian budget, 400 million dollars to support the Jordanian armed forces to buy American equipment, 350 million dollars from the Economic Support Fund for the US International Development Agency programs, and $ 75 million from the support fund Economic to support economic reforms and the public sector in Jordan.
Abbasi believes that stopping US military aid will harm American companies, and for Jordan, the value of military support The introduction to it can be compensated for Jordan's relations with other donor countries.
The Jordanian government considered that the duration of the new memorandum is an important factor in support of stability and financial prediction of the Kingdom.
Congress regularly exceeded the agreed levels in the Memorandum of Understanding, allocating between 1.5 billion dollars and $ 1.65 billion of total annual aid to Jordan since 2018.
The United States was heading to provide approximately $ 2.1 billion as annual aid to Jordan in 2025, which is more than the value committed to it.

Military cooperation between the United States and Jordan is an essential component of bilateral relations.
US military aid is primarily heading towards enabling the Jordanian army to buy and maintain American weapons systems.
Drew Deselver, a writer at the Pew Research Center in the United States, told the BBC that the US government separates foreign aid (which mainly aims at humanitarian or economic development purposes) and military assistance (arms sales and transportation, and the financing of arms purchases).
Until last month, most foreign aid was passing through the agency (USAID), while managing most of the military aid through the US State Department, according to Deselver.
Since 2015, the US State Department has provided 2.155 billion dollars in military financing, making Jordan the third largest global recipient for foreign military financing money during that time period.
The US Department of Defense has provided 327 million dollars to the Jordanian Armed Forces since 2018.
The United States has supported the Jordanian border security program, an integrated system to monitor 350 miles from the land border of Jordan since 2009, at a cost of more than 234 million dollars.

This is not the first time that Washington has used aid as a pressure tool for Jordan.
In 1991, Congress agreed to stop 27 million dollars of military aid to the Kingdom in response to ""Jordan's sympathy for Iraq during the Gulf War.""
The Congress gave President George Bush's opportunity to abolish the ban if he sees that aid is in the American national interest, and Congress confirmed that Jordan helps to push the peace process in the Middle East and complies with the sanctions imposed by the United Nations on Iraq and stopped all aid to Iraq, and confessed to the right Israel in existence, and agreed to hold direct negotiations with Israel.
In 2020, 18 groups of American Jewish organizations invited pressure on Jordan to hand over Jordanian dreams required for the American judiciary, and they urged Washington to ""use all pressure"", including possible discounts of US financial aid, to pressure Jordan to implement the delivery agreement.
In the same year, the Associated Press said that the Trump administration is considering blocking aid from Jordan, in an attempt to carry Amman to hand over Al -Tamimi.
The Trump administration confirmed during its first presidential term that it is studying ""all options to pressure Jordan to hand over Al -Tamimi.""",UK
"On Thursday, the King of Jordan, Abdullah II, warned of the danger of escalation in the West Bank and occupied Jerusalem, reaffirming the refusal to displace the Palestinians.

This came during his meeting with the capital Amman, a delegation from the American House of Representatives headed by a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Deputy Daril Issa, according to a statement by the Royal Court.

The statement stated that the developments of the region were ""discussed"", as the King of Jordan warned of ""the danger of escalation in the West Bank and Jerusalem.""

The aggression of the Israeli occupation army in the northern West Bank, since January 21, has left 59 Palestinian martyrs, according to the Ministry of Health, as well as the displacement of thousands of others, and widespread destruction in property, homes and infrastructure.

Since the start of the genocide in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli occupation army and the settlers expanded their attacks in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, killing at least 920 Palestinians, wounding about 7,000, and arresting 14 thousand and 500 others, according to official Palestinian data.

The King of Jordan stressed ""the necessity of intensifying international efforts to achieve a fair and comprehensive peace on the basis of a two -state solution (Palestinian and Israeli).""

He referred to ""the central role of the United States in paying Those efforts, ""according to the same statement.

He reaffirmed ""Jordan's rejection of any attempts to displace the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and the need to sustain the ceasefire in Gaza, and to enhance the humanitarian response.""

This came days after the King of Jordan confirmed to US President Donald Trump, after talks between the two parties at the White House on Tuesday, his refusal to displace the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank.

Since last January, Trump has been promoting the plan to displace the Palestinians of Gaza into neighboring countries such as Egypt and Jordan, which was rejected by the two countries, and other Arab countries and regional and international organizations have joined them.

On February 4, Trump revealed during a press conference that he collected with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, his country's intention to seize Gaza after the displacement of the Palestinians from it to other countries, stating Egypt, including Egypt And Jordan.

While Egypt is working on crystallizing and offering a comprehensive Arab plan for the reconstruction of Gaza without the displacement of the Palestinians from it, for fear of liquidating the Palestinian issue through the displacement.

With American support, Israel committed between October 7, 2023 and January 19, 2025, a group extermination in Gaza that left more than 160,000 martyrs and wounded Palestinians, most of them children and women, and more than 14,000 missing.

The tour of the newspapers that we present to you on Sunday discusses issues on the Gaza Strip after the start of the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, in light of the preparation for the second stage negotiations, during which it is assumed that the next day of the war is assumed.
And the American magazine Newsweek titled an article by Jonathan Shanzer and Maryam Wahba, ""Does the Egyptian president become the least preferred by Trump?"" Describing the Egyptian President as ""dictator"".
The article discusses the consequences of the Egyptian rejection of President Donald Trump's request from Egypt to receive Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, on the relationship between Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi.
The article did not rule out that the strong relationship between Sisi and Trump had turned into a lukewarm relationship.
In their article, Shanzer and Wahba linked Egypt to join South Africa's lawsuit in its legal case before the International Court of Justice, accusing Israel of war crimes and the case of receiving Palestinians from Gaza.

The article notes that ""it is not clear whether Egypt has officially filed a complaint, because the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has never determined what it might require it. However, the prevailing perception across the Middle East is that Cairo joined the legal war campaign. ""
And ""with Egypt's rejection of Trump's plan to temporarily resettle Gaza residents, Cairo must explain its position ..."". The author of the article believes that if Egypt is considered a war crime, it has to receive refugees. While Egypt is afraid to empty the Gaza Strip from its residents, according to Egyptian media.
The article returned to Trump's first term, and said that it was ""a golden era of relations between the United States and Egypt"", pointing to Trump's ""excessive"" praise of Sisi as a ""wonderful man"", after their first meeting and later announced that Sisi is his ""preferred dictator.""

It is worth the end
This relationship was translated into financial support, with Cairo continuing to receive a large aid package, while the White House refrained from ""addressing Sisi's violations of human rights or his authoritarian practices.""
At that time, Trump looked at the strong leadership of Sisi as it constitutes a balance in the efforts to combat terrorism, especially against the Islamic State known as ""ISIS"" in Sinai, and he saw in Sisi as a fortress against Egypt Political Islam, as the article explains.
In its article, the newspaper said that Trump provided diplomatic legitimacy and financial assistance, which strengthened Sisi's local grip and enabled him to expand Egypt's regional influence.
Now, there are ""sufficient reasons for doubting Egypt's commitment to combating terrorism, especially with regard to enthusiasm"", from the article's point of view.
Trump's invitation to Egypt to receive refugees may indicate a change in the strategy by the United States.
The article cited ""leaked intelligence information"" about an Egyptian -Russian military cooperation, and Sisi was absent from an important meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinkne in 2024 to attend the BRICS summit in Russia, and to deepen Cairo for its relations with Beijing.
Shanzer Wahba spoke about a worsening economic crisis in Egypt in light of ""high inflation, debt, unemployment and internal resentment."" They said, ""The social disturbances are looming on the horizon.""
Here, the article saw that this ""may open the door for American aid to buy Egyptian loyalty,"" but Cairo may not be open to that, as it has already rejected the money from the Gulf states to help solve the refugee crisis in Gaza and isolate the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), according to the article .
And to The Israeli newspaper ""Jerusalem Post"", which published an article entitled ""Israel should take advantage of the opportunity to prevent Hamas's return"", focuses on the second stage negotiations of the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip.
The newspaper stated, ""Trump says that he wants peace, and Israel must take advantage of this momentum so that Hamas does not have any opportunity again, to form a terrorist threat to the Jewish state, as it did before,"" according to the newspaper's description.
It is assumed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will hold a meeting with Trump next Tuesday, at a time when he is preparing to start the second stage negotiations, on Monday, that is, the sixteenth day of the first stage.
Photo released, Reuters
However, the newspaper says, ""From an objective point of view, it is a bad deal ... but it is a deal that must continue until the end.""
The article saw that Israel would be ready to end the war if Hamas stops existence as a military, civil and political force.
He added that Trump's message is clear and frank: ""The images of the war must end,"" and he does not want to see Hamas leading Gaza more than Israel's leadership of the Strip.
He talked about the need to use Netanyahu to all the tools available to him to persuade Trump that The goals of Israel and Hamas cannot be compatible, and this means more support for Israel if it eventually returns to the fighting.
And the newspaper ""Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed"" published an article for a beneficial good entitled ""Israel and the day after the ceasefire agreement"", in which the second stage of the ceasefire is discussed.
Nafaa said that the agreement ""does not stipulate a permanent ceasefire, but it opens the way to achieve it, and does not resolve all contentious issues, but it obliges the two parties to the conflict to enter into indirect negotiations to discuss the remainder of them, and to overcome the obstacles that hinder their leveling.""
The start of the implementation of the second stage of agreement depends on the success of negotiations that must take place during the first stage, and to continue under the auspices of the brokers, until it ends with a detailed agreement that begins ""by announcing a sustainable truce where a permanent endowment of military operations and all hostilities.""
He also said that ""Netanyahu accepted the agreement forced, and he desires strongly to inform him and insult an opportunity for this, and he clearly realizes that the agreement is not in his favor, and it may lead to the disintegration of the government from which Itamar bin Ghafir withdrew, and threatens to ask Smotic to withdraw from it if Netanyahu does not resume. Fighting at the end of the first stage. ""
Nafia saw that Netanyahu's ability to violate the agreement and return to the fighting is limited, for many objective reasons; Internal and external. After the completion of the first stage, Hamas will continue to retain its most important negotiating papers, which are ""holding detainees, some of whom are military with high ranks, and all the inhabitants of the north in the Strip will have returned to their areas despite the region's lack of life.""
""The Hamas movement, along with the rest of the resistance factions, would have been able to reorganize its ranks, and the internal (Israeli) public opinion supports the largest percentage of it to implement the agreement in its three stages,"" says Nafaa.

It seems clear that Trump wants the agreement to reach its end, and the resumption of fighting may lead to confusion of Trump's foreign agenda, given his urgent need to a degree of calm in the Middle East region, according to the article.
The author of the article believes that the American president has priorities in other regions, and the war in the region again will block his plans to search for a ""new century deal"" believed to be better to meet the interests of Israel, especially since American military experts are convinced that Return to the fighting will not eliminate Hamas, and the Israeli army will not be able to constantly control the Strip.
""Despite all the tremendous destruction that Netanyahu caused in the region, and the achievements he achieved in battles on various fronts, he has not yet gained war, and he will not be able to win it, as long as he does not have a perception of the future of the region without the full liquidation of the Palestinian issue, It is a goal that the resistance in the region has proven impossible to be investigated.

"This summit comes within the framework of unified and rare Arab endeavors to ""set the rules for confronting"" US President Donald Trump's plan on the Gaza Strip, before ""crowd Arab countries"" behind ""a unified position"" at an expanded emergency summit in Cairo, analysts reported.
The Trump's proposal caused amazement when he announced last week that his plan was to control the United States on the Gaza Strip, rebuild destroyed areas, and convert them into ""Middle East Rvira"" after the Palestinians were deported to another place without a plan to return them.
The shocking proposal faced widespread regional and international reactions, as well as a unified Arab move in a rare form.

Arab countries have doubled, including historical allies of the United States, such as Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar, their diplomatic efforts During the past few days, to emphasize the refusal of Trump and the uprooting of the Palestinians from the Palestinian territories.
Egypt said that it would host an emergency Arab summit ""to address the dangerous developments of the Palestinian cause.""

Trump adheres to his suggestion on every occasion, and requires that the Gaza Strip ownership be for the United States, with his residents to move to Jordan and Egypt without having the right to return after its reconstruction.
Trump retracted on Tuesday from his illumination with ""cutting"" American aid to Jordan and Egypt if they refuse to receive more than two million Palestinians from Gaza.

He warned of ""the danger of attempts to displace the Palestinians
In the West Bank and Gaza, ""stressing that"" any solution will not be at the expense of security and stability
Jordan and the region. ”
The official movement of the King of Jordan came in parallel
My last popularity, as the country's governorates, last Friday, witnessed marches of anger and protest against the Trump scheme
To seize Gaza and displace the Palestinians from it.
It serves This plan is the interests of the Israeli occupation, and Washington has supported the war of genocide that it launched on Gaza between October 7
2023 and 19 January, left about 160,000 martyrs and wounded Palestinians.
Jordan's official and popular positions came
Payed by regional and international rejection, as many countries have condemned Trump's billionaire real estate statements
Previous, as it is not implemented and threatens security and stability in the region.
These data indicate that the Jordanian summit
The American will be fraught with risks, especially since Trump's scheme is identical to his ally ""Israel"".
That is looking for the next step to apply.
The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin was considered
Netanyahu, in a statement to the American ""Fox News"" channel on Saturday night, Sunday, that a plan
Trump is ""innovative"", and ""a place to displace the Palestinians must be found.""
Netanyahu's desire to implement the Trump scheme for displacement
Perhaps, according to observers, it may lead to the failure of the ceasefire in Gaza since December 19
Last January, and thus a return to a more severe war to achieve displacement.
Jordan realizes, according to official and popular moves,
The danger of the displacement scheme, especially on security The Kingdom, and its breach of its demographic composition, and its repercussions
On its stability and economy, which means that the king will insist on his rejectionist position.
But an attempt to involve Egypt in the displacement plan,
Netanyahu's call to establish a Palestinian state in Saudi Arabia and his talk about the need to find a place
For displacement, it will exacerbate the seriousness of the situation.
This situation enumerates the parties to the confrontation with ""Israel"",
What may impose on Trump to retract his plan for fear of the interests of Washington in the region, with care
To achieve other gains that may reach the point of interfering in how to manage Gaza affairs.
And Tuesday, Trump revealed, during a press conference
With Netanyahu at the White House, his country's intention to seize Gaza and displace the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip
To other countries.
Trump told reporters on the presidential plane
Sunday evening, it is ""committed to buying and possessing Gaza"", as it is ""a special real estate site
We cannot leave it .. We will rebuild Gaza across other wealthy countries in the Middle East. ""
American risks
On Tuesday's agenda, a professor said
Political science at the German -Jordanian University (official) Badr Al -Mady: ""Certainly a meeting

With a leadership that has a historical accumulation in diplomatic and political dealing, which makes the fruit of the meeting
His content is completely different from what Trump spoke for long days on the issue of Gaza and the issue of displacement. ""
And it is likely that ""the issue of Gaza and the displacement will be
The most present in the meeting, and Trump will try to raise the ceiling (his demands) as it raised it in days
Previous, it will also offer windows, solutions or proposals and the king will be ready for them. ""
And ""I think the king carries a lot in his possession,
What will contribute effectively to trying to change the American novel that appears to have been controlled

Arab -Jordanian -Jordanian narration, so that there will be a new orientation or the king tries to take from

However, he added, ""But practical solutions will also be offered,

The Palestinian and Arab side, but also what the Israelis will offer and their conviction by going to the region
To more stability and calm. ""

With a very important Arab position on Egypt and Saudi Arabia and a regional power such as Türkiye, and the international community
He did not hesitate to condemn Trump's statements, in addition to the American internal frequency, especially with the party
Republican, and the position of the Democratic Party in general. ""
And the past is likely that ""the topic
Aid
The American, which Trump stopped over the countries of the world, including Jordan, will be the course of research in the meeting. ""
I refer to that ""this aid maintains
On the security and stability of the Jordanian state and the security and stability of the region, in light of what is happening in the East region

In the same context, Egyptian Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouly emphasized that the Gaza issue is the ""main work"" For Cairo at the present time, he pointed out that the Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdel -Ati made ""shuttle tours"" in a number of Arab and international capitals to clarify the Egyptian position, especially in light of the American pressures for the displacement of Gaza population to other countries.

"
A few days ago, US President Donald Trump sat at the Oval Office alongside the Jordanian monarch, King Abdullah, to renew his adherence to his plan to control Gaza and transfer it to ""Riviera Middle East"" after its people were removed from it, he said.
With his full confidence, Trump told reporters that the Palestinians will love the places that he will give them- after taking them out of Gaza. As for the motive for this confidence: Trump ""knows the real estate sector well"" and has achieved ""great success.""
This offering may seem far from the traditional approach that formed US policy in the Middle East for decades, which, despite its great support for Israel, adopted the two -state solution as a basis for dealing with the Palestinian -Israeli conflict. But it is not necessarily surprising, given Trump's biography as a businessman who sees many things from the development and investment perspective. It seems that he now wants to apply this approach to one of the most complex issues in the region.
Are there economic motives behind the Trump plan? What is Gaza's economic capabilities that can be invested? Is there a future for a prosperous economy in the sector away from Trump's vision?

Trump began His career is a real estate developer in New York State in the 1970s, when the state was facing bankruptcy due to excessive public spending and low tax revenues.
End proposed stories
At that time, Trump found a rare- and cheap opportunity to acquire the famous Komodor Hotel, renew it and transfer it to the Grand Hayat Luxury Hotel, which became one of the symbols of the transformation that he witnessed among the Manhattan suburb, which moved from an area affected by the American economic crisis, to one of the richer places in the world.
Trump obtained huge tax exemptions from New York State as part of the deal, which represented its launch as a large name in the real estate world in the state, and from there to build what can be described as an economic empire that included investments in the field of real estate, hotels, resorts and entertainment.
While this empire contributed to efforts to develop poor neighborhoods in a number of American states and to create many job opportunities, its rise was tainted with accusations of fraud, exploitation of employment and displacement of people with low incomes from their areas.

It is worth the end
On the other hand, says Victoria Cots, who worked as a member of Trump's National Security Adviser during his first presidential term, says what Trump on Gaza represents a practical plan for the next day of the war in the Strip.
""There has been a lot of bustle and talk about this during the past fifteen months,"" but Trump is the first leader to present a plan to deal with the topic.
Kuts confirms that Trump's plan was driven by the difficult humanitarian situation in Gaza, and with his desire to present an alternative to the population there.
Indeed, Trump had said that Gaza was more like ""hell"", adding that people there ""only knew death and destruction"", and that their survival in the Strip was because there is no other alternative.
The United Nations estimates the damage or collapse of about 69% of buildings in the sector, which knows ""unprecedented levels in modern history"" of destruction.
As for the cost of reconstruction, it is estimated By more than 50 billion dollars, in a process that may take years, according to the international organization.
But the Palestinian writer, Ahmed Najjar, refuses to portray Trump's idea as an attempt to save the Gazans from the tragic situation in the Strip, and says that ""we must think about those who turned Gaza into hell.""
Najjar believes that ""the United States helped Israel convert Gaza into hell by providing it with weapons and supporting them without conditions.""
As for a carpenter, Trump's plan is to remove about two million Palestinian people from Gaza, a ""ethnic cleansing"" plan.
He says: ""There is no other way to describe the matter, whatever the way we look at it, from a legal or moral point of view, what is going on is an ethnic cleansing plan to try to force people to displace their homes and lands.""
As for Victoria Kuts, a former Trump administration official, he confirms that the American president ""has never spoken to force people to go out"", but she does not provide an answer to the question about how to deal with those who may refuse to leave the sector.
Trump confirms his confidence that people in Gaza will want to leave, and they will be better in the places that will be built for them in Jordan and Egypt, provided that the ""neighboring wealthy countries"" will pay costs Building.
So far, it seems that some Arab countries are trying to provide an alternative to Trump's plan, as the Jordanian monarch indicated when he visited Washington that Egypt is working to prepare an alternative plan, which guarantees the reconstruction of the sector without the displacement of its residents, as Cairo says.
Waiting for the announcement of the details of the Egyptian plan, many details remain absent from the plan announced by Trump.
The American writer, Gwinda Blair, believes that the absence of this details is an extension of the ""salesman"" method that Trump follows to deal with the files before him, which leaves him space to retreat from what he said or re -interpreting him differently.
""We can see this method in many Trump's statements, it is not completely clear, there is always space for maneuvering and replacement, as it carries shocking ideas so that any idea is less acceptable.""
But those who literally take Trump's statements indicate that the signs of his announced plan recently appeared about a year ago by his son -in -law Jared Kushner, who had said at an event at Harvard University that ""real estate on the waterfront of Gaza can be of great value, If people focus on providing livelihoods, ""adding that"" from a destination Israeli vision can be transported outside the region and cleaned. ""
And the American writer, Gwinda Blair, does not rule out that Kushner had played a role in crystallizing the plan announced by Trump, and Kushner ""was working in the field of real estate, and he is very interested in making commercial deals in the region.""
Kushner, who had described the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians as ""nothing more than a real estate conflict"", was the engineer of the century deal- known as the peace and prosperity plan- that Trump has put forward in recent months of his first presidential term.
The deal, which the Palestinians rejected, included economic incentives and promises of investments of about 50 billion dollars, but without granting them a full Palestinian state.
And the professor of economics at Al -Azhar University in Gaza, Dr. Samir Abu Meddala, believes that Trump's interest and before him his son -in -law Kushner in Gaza is not necessarily economic attention. He says that the waterfront of Gaza does not exceed 41 kilometers, while ""there are countries that have coasts exceeding 2000 km"", which can be developed and converted into tourist resorts.
Trump's plan for Gaza appears, according to Abu Mudhlla, ""is linked to his political plans that he launched in his first presidential term, which wants to Economic solutions are provided at the expense of political solutions and Palestinian sovereignty, ""which is a Palestinian.
But Victoria Kuts, who worked in the previous Trump administration, says that ""instead of describing the plan with ethnic cleansing, the Palestinians may interact with it, or come to the negotiating table with a new proposal.""
And remember that the Palestinian refusal of the century deal did not stop the signing of the ""Abrahamic agreements"" because ""the rest of the Arab countries decided not to give the Palestinians the permanent veto of regional policies.""
And she adds: While the Palestinians have the right to ""reject the Trump plan for Gaza, and they have previously rejected the peace and prosperity plan"" they must ""think seriously before refusing another offer to provide it with good intention of a person trying to do something positive for their future.""
As for Abu Muddalla, he believes that the hypothesis of reaching a solution to political issues by providing economic incentives is a short hypothesis, and indicates that ""when the Al -Aqsa Intifada erupted in 2000 there were about 200,000 Palestinians working inside Israel,"" but the outbreak of the uprising came as a result of the closure of the political horizon.
He says: ""If political problems are solved, this will lead to an economic recovery, not the opposite,"" but it does not deny the difficult economic reality What the Gaza Strip was living even before the outbreak of the recent war and the almost complete destruction of the sector's economy.

Abu Medallah says that the most prominent wealth enjoyed by the Gaza economy is human wealth, despite its limited area and the poverty of its natural resources, the sector recorded high rates in the levels of education, while the majority of its population are young people who are able to work and many of them have technical skills, which indicates. To the possibility of creating a knowledge economy in the sector.
The Gaza Strip has faced many economic challenges, since drawing its borders in the armistice agreement signed between Egypt and Israel after the 1948 war. In that year, the sector received about 250 thousand refugees from the Palestinians who left or removed from their villages that have become part of Israel, which doubled its population of four Times within days. As for those who are within the borders of the Strip, tens of thousands of them lost their source of livelihood after their agricultural lands became within the emerging borders of the State of Israel.
During the period of the Egyptian administration and even after the Israeli occupation in 1967, the Agriculture Triangle is one of the most prominent sources of income in Gaza, as well as a number of industries Simple as the food, fabric and furniture industry. But the services sector ranked first as the largest local income sources.
According to the United Nations reports, the period of the Israeli rule of the sector witnessed a growth in the dependency of its economy for Israel as a major market for employment and products, at the expense of achieving real development inside it, which left it vulnerable to the fluctuations of Israeli politics and restrictions in addition to political tensions in the region that hardly calms down.
A report issued in 2022 by the United Nations Trade and Development Conference indicates that the Palestinian economy was structured in a way that made it strongly dependent on the Israeli economy, which caused heavy losses to the Palestinian economy.
Despite Israel's withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, it remained the greatest domination of the lives of its residents and the path of their economy, Abu Mudalla said.
For example, it refers to the restrictions imposed by Israel on the exports of the sector of fruits and roses abroad after the 2000 uprising, and to its closure of the commercial port of Gaza and its bombing of its airport, which was established under the Oslo agreement, the steps that Israel said came for security reasons.
In the beginning of 2006, the Palestinian territories witnessed legislative elections that ended with a victory Hamas, which led to a Palestinian internal crisis that ended with a division that continues until now, resulted in the emergence of two executive powers, one in the West Bank led by the Palestinian Authority, and another in the Gaza Strip that Hamas imposed its control after battles with the factions of the Palestinian Authority led by the movement to open.
After Hamas took control of the Strip, Israel stressed the restrictions imposed on it, and closed three of the five wild crossings that bind it to it, and imposed restrictions on agriculture as well as on fishing activities in it, and exacerbated the bad conditions, the devastation left by the military escalation rounds that the sector witnessed over the years. The past sixteen, without talking about the destruction caused by the last war.
In 1999, the company ""British Petroleum"" discovered a naval gas field, about 30 km from the Gaza coast, known as ""Gaza Marin"".
The size of the field is relatively small, with an estimated 30 billion cubic meters, compared to the precautions off the Israeli beaches estimated at about 1,000 billion cubic meters.
Ritug adds the small size The field has the discovered company to exclude the idea of ??developing it due to the high cost of the infrastructure that must be created to start drilling operations.
However, the image changed with the discovery of Israel's huge amounts of gas in the fields of Tamar (2009) and Leviathhan (2010) adjacent, according to Ritug, as building an underwater infrastructure to develop these two fields was economically feasible.
“Once the infrastructure of the Israeli gas fields is created, the start of developing the Gaza Maritime field has become feasible, because instead of building his own pits, his own treatment platforms and his own pipeline that extends to the Gaza beach, which is very expensive, it is possible to contact the infrastructure Israeli, which makes the field more continuous. ""
But Israel did not agree at the time to allow the field to develop for fear that its revenues would go to the Hamas movement, which was then controlled by the Gaza Strip, says Ritog.
Despite the revival of the fields of development of the field in cooperation between Egypt and the Palestinian Authority after the rise recorded by gas prices in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, none of this did not happen, the October 7 attack carried out by Hamas in Israel and the war that followed, everything, was suspended. Ritage.
The professor of economics at Al -Azhar University in Gaza, Dr. Samir Abu Meddala, says that the small size of the Gaza Marine field makes it unlikely that the desire to control gas will be the motive behind Trump's plan to extend US control of the Gaza Strip.

This does not deny the existence of economic motives behind the Trump's plan for Gaza, which goes further than it was in the deal of the century, as it wants to displace the Palestinians from the Strip instead of giving them economic incentives, according to Abu Mudalla.
Abu Mudalla sees that control of Gaza and its separation from the West Bank aims to undermine any opportunity for an independent, sovereign Palestinian state to establish its economy. He says that if the sector was removed from its isolation, it would become a vital economic gateway to the future Palestinian state, with the possibility of developing the Gaza port to become a logistical center, especially in light of its distinctive geographical location.
If this project is implemented, Gaza reserves of gas can block the future needs of the Palestinian state of gas for about 15 years, allowing it to have some economic independence, which is agreed upon by both Abu Meddala and Retg.
Abu Muddalla is not alone in the perception of an economic role for Gaza as a state gateway The Palestinian, as it is possible to see features of his perception in the ""Reconciliation Gaza, Palestine"" vision, which was developed by Palestinian researchers, economists and businessmen in 2021.
Gaza appears in this vision a prosperous area, dependent on a knowledge economy, a network of roads, as well as a modern port and airport, as well as the development of the agricultural sector, without neglecting a role played by the tourism sector.
It stands without achieving this vision of great obstacles, not the least of which is the continuation of the Palestinian division, but it remains, even if it intensifies with what Trump is now offering, a vision that sees Gaza prosperous with Palestinian hands, not a tourist resort, emptying his family, so that the rich from all over the world intends.",UK
"On Wednesday, Israel threatened a ""new war"", so the Gaza Strip did not release Hamas from the hostages by Saturday, and talked about linking this war to the implementation of the plan of US President Donald Trump, which requires evacuating the Palestinian sector of its residents.
On the other hand, he confirmed that she rejected what she described as ""American and Israeli threats"", confirming its commitment to the ceasefire, and asking Israel to implement the conditions of the agreement.
In a related context, the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation quoted government officials, that it obtained permission from the United States to stay in several points in southern Lebanon after the date of the ceasefire.
The terms of the agreement, which was concluded in November between Lebanon and Israel, confirm that the Israeli army withdraws from southern Lebanon by January 26 in exchange for the withdrawal of Hezbollah fighters and the deployment of Lebanese forces. Despite the extension of the date until February 18, a Lebanese official and a foreign diplomat reported that Israel had requested an additional extension for ten days.
On Wednesday, Radio indicated that Israel obtained American permission to stay in several points in southern Lebanon after the specified date. The US State Department has not yet commented on this.
Hamas renewed its rejection of ""the language of threats"", It announced its commitment to the armistice, provided that the terms of the agreement were respected to release the hostages and the detainees.
The movement called for ""solidarity demonstrations"" between Friday and Sunday in various countries of the world, in rejection of any attempt to displace the Palestinians from Gaza. Coinciding with this, the Hamas delegation arrived at the Cairo meeting with Egyptian security officials regarding the armistice.
A Palestinian source announced that Qatar and Egypt are working ""extensively"" to prevent the ceasefire collapsing, at a time when Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi confirmed during a call with Jordan's King Abdullah II on the ""unit of the two positions"" who refuse to deport Gaza residents.
A statement of the Palestinian Foreign Ministry praised the position of the Jordanian monarch during his meeting with President Termond Trump Washington, as he renewed the rejection of the displacement plan.
On Wednesday, the Jordanian monarch discussed ""dangerous developments"" in Gaza and the West Bank during a telephone conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron.
The White House announced that Trump sees the ""transfer"" of the Palestinians from Gaza ""more convenient"", despite the opposition of Jordanian King Abdullah II.
In the context, the UAE Ambassador to Washington, Youssef Al -Otaiba, pointed to a ""Saab"" approach by the United States on the issue of Gaza, while Germany has strengthened Its decision to participate in police forces in the European Union missions to follow up the situation in the Palestinian territories.
Qatar announced its intention to supply the Gaza Strip with 15 million liters of fuel, bringing the volume of Qatari support to 30 million liters per total.
Al -Azhar Al -Sharif in Cairo also called for the support of the Arab position rejecting the displacement, while the International Committee of the Red Cross appealed to the two parties to abide by the armistice.
On a field level, the Israeli army confirmed the summoning of reserve soldiers, in anticipation of the possibility of resuming the fighting.",FR

"Over the past decades, and the external politics of the Arab Republic of Egypt, it is pushing for development and renewal, especially in the twenty -one and twenty -one centuries.
As Egyptian -Israeli relations were one of the decisive factors of the entire Middle East policy, and at the beginning of the twenty -first century it was and still was the foreign policy of the Arab Republic of Egypt, multi -directional and very active, in addition to solving the problem of the Arab -Israeli conflict, as the ""country of the pyramids"" attaches great attention to the neighboring situation of its borders Where Cairo is concerned with moderate regulations that do not participate in regional conflicts and in this regard, there is no doubt that Cairo's relations are fine With its Arab neighbors on the African continent - Libya and Sudan.
The Egyptian foreign policy towards the Israeli -Palestinian conflict was to emphasize that the essence of the problem is the occupation of the Palestinian territories by the Israeli forces, the violence against civilians, the building of settlements in the occupied territories, and many other illegal acts carried out by the Israeli government. The Egyptian position calls for the withdrawal of the Israeli forces until the 1967 borders and the implementation of the legitimate right of the people The Palestinian in establishing his state, and this reflects Egypt's position on the Palestinian issue, and that it is interested in reaching a political solution to this problem, which gives hope that the Arab -Israeli relations will move from the world of confrontation to the world of mutual understanding, peaceful coexistence and cooperation in the future.
This is what Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi stressed in all his meetings and statements that the establishment of an independent Palestinian state is the best way to ensure the security of the Palestinian and Israeli peoples, ""and that the Palestinians will never accept the presence of Israeli forces on their lands to protect the Jewish settlements.

In the end, the Egyptian diplomatic and humanitarian role in the Gaza Strip constitutes a pivotal role in promoting regional stability and alleviating human suffering, by providing urgent assistance to the residents of Gaza, by opening the crossings, facilitating the entry of food and medical aid, as well as the continuation of its endeavors with international and Arab organizations To ensure the arrival of aid effectively and quickly, as Egypt was and the safety valve for the Palestinian issue and the protective shield is still against The plan to displace the Palestinian people, especially as it was the main and effective role in mediation efforts between the Palestinians, and the support efforts Palestinians in establishing their independent state, which reflects its deep commitment to the Palestinian cause and the rights of the Palestinian people.",PS

Among the recommendations rejected by Cairo is the abolition of the death penalty, as Abdel -Ati stressed that the Egyptian constitution and law ""stipulate this punishment as a deterrent measure of specific crimes, stressing that it is carried out with strict guarantees, such as the multiplicity of litigation of litigation, and the need for the courts of the Court of Cassation to support the ruling, to The final certification of the President of the Republic.

On December 17, 2024, 12 Egyptian human rights organizations have published a joint report on what it described as ""the exacerbation of the human rights crisis in Egypt during the past five years."" The organizations presented a copy of this report to the United Nations before Cairo reviewed their legal file for the fourth time this year ago, a few days after three times in 2010, 2014 and 2019.

""What we monitored in the report from human rights violations in Egypt, such as violations related to the right to life and combating execution, torture and forced concealment, the conditions of places of detention, the length of pretrial detention, and the continuation of imprisonment in opinion issues, means that there is no progress since the review Previous in 2019.

However, the American website Axius stated that the phone call touched on the issue of the displacement of the invaders that Sisi had previously came out with recently conclusive statements about it, refusing to displace them and any participation of Egypt in it. So, why did Sisi not discuss it in contact according to the official statement of the Egyptian presidency? And if he had discussed it, according to the novel ""Axios"", then why did the statement be silent about it?

The Egyptian Presidency Office said that Sisi assured Trump, in the communication, that the international community ""is counting"" on its ability ""to reach a permanent and historical peace agreement that ends the existing state of conflict in the region."" For his part, Axius said, on Saturday, that Trump discussed with his Egyptian counterpart in communication, the idea of ??displacement The invaders to Egypt and Jordan for the reconstruction of the sector. The site quoted officials as saying that Trump's comments on the displacement of invaders are linked to the massive destruction in the sector and the need for huge reconstruction efforts. The White House envoy in the Middle East region, Steve Witkeov, told the site that the process of reconstruction of the sector may take between 10 to 15 years, stressing that Gaza is ""not valid for housing"" currently.

Ahmed Bahaa El -Din Shaaban: I am very reliable on the solid state institutions in confronting the displacement project
Seriousness in facing the Gazans displacement plan
Commenting on Trump's proposal and the Egyptian position on it, the Secretary -General of the Egyptian Socialist Party, Eng. Bahaa El -Din Shaaban, expressed his hope that the Egyptian moves will be a really serious message from Cairo confirming Sisi's categorical rejection of the displacement, and not to turn into a mere negotiation paper through which the regime seeks to Improving the conditions for negotiating a fateful issue, as any concession in it represents a serious prejudice to Egyptian national security.

The dilemma of Gaza's rubble ... the reconstruction needs For many years and tens of billions

Shaban, in an interview with Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed, expressed his strong dissatisfaction with the incitement of power to the people to demonstrate in rejecting the issue of displacement of invaders and liquidating the Palestinian issue, at a time when the authorities are still holding dozens of citizens who went out in the demonstration on October 20, 2023, in response to an invitation The same system, and raised slogans in support of the Palestinian cause. He pointed out that this contradiction raises many questions about the extent of the regime's seriousness in rejecting the displacement and confronting attempts to liquidate the Palestinian issue, explaining that Egypt possesses many papers that it can use to thwart this plan, if it wants, including waving the freezing of the peace agreement with Israel, And send a clear message that the Trump project about the displacement of invaders will lead to destabilization in the region and the world, which is what Washington cannot bear it, especially since the experience of peace between Egypt and Israel is a vital matter for the United States, and it seeks to generalize it, not to its setback.

Shaaban said that he relies heavily on the ""solid state institutions"" in confronting the project of displacement of invading and the plan to liquidate the Palestinian issue, As one of the pillars of the Egyptian national security, which does not accept any complacency, warning that the implementation of Trump's offering will make Tel Aviv as a ""region police"" and its actual ruler, which is something that Egypt will reject altogether and in detail.


Many pressure tools
For his part, the Palestinian historian Abdelkader Yassin stressed that the serious tools that Egypt owns to thwart this plan is many, including ""a serious move to stop normalization in all its forms with the Zionist enemy, especially on the economic level, by stopping the import of Israeli gas, and convincing Jordan to take a similar position "". He also called for the necessity of forming a strong and unified Arab front to confront the project of the displacement of the invaders, which Trump is put forward, with the importance of making real and serious efforts to enhance Palestinian national unity, as the absence of a unified national project facilitates the enemies of the Palestinian people to implement the plans of displacement and liquidating the issue. Yassin stressed in an interview with Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed, the need to build on the steadfastness of the Palestinian factions in the field, and to invest their success in thwarting the plans of displacement or liquidation, pointing out that the Egyptian regime may seem serious in rejecting displacement and liquidation, but, in light of the current conditions of the country, It may not be Stadium to thwart this scheme in a practical way. 
Doubts of motives

Abdel -Qader Yassin: The Egyptian regime may seem serious about the refusal of the displacement, but it may not be able to thwart the scheme

On the other hand, the former Egyptian Foreign Minister, Ambassador Abdullah Al -Ash'al, expressed great doubts about the motives of power behind these statements, movements and demonstrations, considering that it may be merely an attempt to wash her hands from the displacement project in the event of its implementation, and remove its responsibility from any role in this scenario, Especially with the increasing American pressure on Cairo, which moved from the stage of seeking help to impose the need to implement the demands.

Al -Ash'al cited the regime's position on the issue of the Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which constitutes an existential threat to Egypt's security and stability, but Cairo, in his opinion, did not move a finger in the face of the different stages of fullness, until the matter turned into a imposed reality, which is feared to repeat it in the file of the displacement of the Palestinians, adding in His conversation with Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed, that the lack of adoption of serious positions towards the genocide to which the Palestinian people are exposed to, and the occupation of a corridor (Philadelphi) and the Rafah crossing (border in the sector with Egypt), and Israel's violation of the peace agreement, Things enhance these concerns.

A solid and decisive position
As for the strategic expert, Major General Ashraf Amin, he saw that Egypt's refusal to displace the invaders into Sinai, and its refusal to liquidate the Palestinian issue, is one of the red lines that cannot be retracted under any circumstance. Amin considered that the demonstrations witnessed by the Egyptian city of Rafah and its crossing, in which tens of thousands of Egyptians participated, constituted a serious message to Washington and Tel Aviv, confirming the categorical refusal of the Egyptians for this project, and also enhanced the presence of a popular back that supports the position of the Egyptian authorities who refuse to displace and liquidate.",UK

"Trump's vision of the rehabilitation of the Gaza Strip is based on purely economic and utilitarian considerations, but it ignores the deep connection of the Palestinians with their land, which is still an essential component of the Palestinian national identity.
President Trump's vision to rehabilitate the Gaza Strip faced widespread opposition by the international community and all the countries of the Middle East, with the exception of Israel, in addition to the refusal of the Palestinians. Trump's vision is based on the idea of ??transporting two million Palestinians living in the sector to other countries, specifically Egypt and the neighboring Jordan, although media reports also reported farther destinations such as Morocco, the Somalia and Puntland. On February 4, last, the US President said: ""I hope we can do something good that does not make them want to return again,"" while members of his administration described the evacuation of the Palestinians as a ""temporary"" or ""phased"" arrangement, and the United States will do yet This is to supervise the rehabilitation project, while other countries will be funded. Gaza is supposed to turn into ""Riviera Middle East"" where people from all over the world can settle in it, while ""the Palestinians will be resettled in safer societies. And beautiful.
In response, both the Palestinian Authority and the Hamas movement - despite their bitter differences on other issues - announced that they will not accept any arrangement that contradicts the Palestinian ""right"", which reflects the spirit of steadfastness that has long prevailed in Palestinian society. The Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas described the plan as a ""serious violation of international law"" and was quick to coordinate with Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to develop a common position. The Hamas movement confirmed that it will not allow ""ethnic cleansing"" and forced displacement of the Palestinians from Gaza, where the prominent member of the movement, Ezzat Al -Rashr, said: ""The plan reflects a deep ignorance of Palestine and the region, Gaza is not a real estate sold and bought, and it is an integral part of our occupied Palestinian land "".
Likewise, the Palestinian public received Trump's declaration with mixed feelings of amazement, anger and frustration. The vast majority of commentators rejected this proposal categorically, and considered it another example of Israel's intention to manage a new catastrophe, as happened during the war, in reference to the term ""Nakba"" that is used to describe the displacement operations that the Palestinians were subjected to during the founding of the State of Israel. A comment to one of the guests, who was conveyed in the media, embodies the size of the general feeling there, as she said: ""We are not an abandoned building that anyone can claim it. We are a people. We belong to this land."" Others sarcastically asked why Trump did not offer the United States as a Palestinian immigration destination. Likewise, Palestinian social media users expressed their dissatisfaction with what they consider an American -Israeli conspiracy to erase their national identity. Many commentators describe the current situation of the Palestinian National Movement as witnessing a significant decline, as it suffers from internal disintegration and weakness and relies heavily on external support to thwart the Trump plan. They also indicated that the movement failed to mobilize widespread popular resistance against the plan. However, some isolated voices appeared between the Palestinians that welcomed the idea of ??Trump, considering it a possible opportunity for a better future for them and their children.
Trump's proposal - which consists of a group of general principles more than being a detailed plan - reflects his primary approach in dealing with political affairs. As a businessman, he looks at individuals as economic creatures that give priority to personal gains The concrete - like the prosperity from which they derive their dignity - are on the abstract collective goals such as national independence and cultural or religious identity. This perspective is also embodied in its proposals related to Greenland, Canada and the Panama channel, where the political concept of ""sovereignty"" is replaced by the term ""ownership"" the ""economic"" and deals with the lands as if it were real estate for sale and purchase.
According to this point of view, providing material advantages to the Palestinians to urge them to abandon their national novel is an attempt to enhance the so -called ""economic peace"". However, this approach can only be achieved between sovereign countries, as none of them is required to abandon basic elements of their identity in exchange for economic gains. A prominent example of this is the ""Abraham"" agreements, the peak of the Trump administration's foreign policy achievements during his previous presidency.
Immigration policies in the past
The idea of ??settling the conflict by stimulating the immigration of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip is not a new idea. In fact, it formed a pivotal element in the Israeli strategy after the occupation of 1967. The signs of this approach appeared early in the occupation. Israeli in the period 1956-1957. In recent years, politicians from the Israeli right -wing current have made similar visions, whether before the outbreak of the current war or in its wake. A study conducted by the researcher Omari Shafir Rafiev, who specialized in studying Israeli policy towards the Palestinians after the Six -Day War, revealed that Israel worked to strengthen initiatives aimed at encouraging the immigration of the Palestinians (actually transferring them) to destinations outside its control, especially Latin America and the Arab Gulf states. Israel also studied scenarios for resettlement of Gaza residents in areas under its control, such as the West Bank, and previously in Sinai.
These policies aimed at the beginning to push the people of Gaza to leave completely, or at least to push a large part of them to leave. However, the failure of these efforts, in addition to internal political discussions - where some questioned whether to reduce the population of Gaza deserves to increase the number of Palestinians in the West Bank - prompted Israel to change its focus and encourage the migration of specific groups of Gaza population. In particular, this included individuals who were classified as extremists or considered a security threat source, especially educated youth. Israel has sought to achieve this goal by reducing appropriate job opportunities in Gaza.
On the ground, the policies specifically designed to encourage the emigration of the Palestinians only performed to leave a very limited number of people. The broader political measures such as opening the border had a greater impact - by 1987, more than 94,000 Gaza population left (nearly A quarter of the residents of the sector in 1967) through ""calm and spontaneous"" migration. Recently, several international organizations reported that between 250,000-350,000 Palestinians left Gaza during the period of Hamas's control of the Strip in 2007 to October 2023. Between 115,000-135,000 other people left between the October 7 attack and the closure of the Rafah crossing in May 2024. According to the results of the survey by the Arab Barometer on September 2023, nearly a third of the Gaza population is five and five. Residents of the West Bank are considering immigration for economic, political, or security reasons, or is linked to the rule. Canada, the United States and Qatar.
Arab concerns
From the point of view of the Arab countries, Trump's plan lacked two fundamental elements: The first: ensuring that part of the Palestinians remain at least in Gaza to prove that the rehabilitation process is possible even with the population survival; The second is to include the process within a political path, even if it is long -term, which ultimately leads to the establishment of a Palestinian state. These countries will seek to show their willingness to contribute effectively by providing financial aid, equipment, consultants and engineering plans, and even the formation of a joint Arab security or civil force in Gaza - a step that has not yet been implemented. These countries also count that this contributes to Trump's pregnancy to give up his plan, especially since the American administration has announced its openness to better alternatives.
At the same time, Qatar and Turkey are making efforts to integrate ""Hamas"" into the institutions of the Palestine Liberation Organization. However, due to the lack of a direct dialogue between ""Fatah"" (the faction controlling the Palestine Liberation Organization) and ""Hamas"", it is unlikely that they can reach a detailed agreement. Instead, both chapters may propose to form a general framework, such as the establishment of a committee Civil affiliated with institutions The Palestine Liberation Organization, in the hope that the Trump administration will see a sufficient measure, at least at the beginning.
conclusion
Trump's vision of the immigration of the Palestinians from Gaza and turns the region to ""Riviera"" on the basis of a pragmatic economic logic, as some Palestinians may migrate if the circumstances are favorable - for example, if they have the necessary means to leave, and if there are welcoming and developed destinations. Group immigration remains as part of an official political plan - especially those that prevent their return - is excluded. Ultimately, the spirit of steadfastness remains a fundamental component of the Palestinian national identity, and without it, the Palestinian national movement will lose its justification.
It should be noted that Trump's vision arises in the context of the vacuum resulting from the absence of a clear and applicable Israeli plan for the ""next day"" in Gaza. If Israel succeeds in formulating such a plan, it will be able to form the situation ""from the river to the sea"", while it opens the way to strengthen relations with Arab countries.

The statements of US President Donald Trump about the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Egypt and Jordan are raising a wave of controversy and anxiety, in light of warnings that they carry deep political and strategic dimensions, reflecting the Trump administration’s directions, so does these statements come within the framework of a greater plan that aims to liquidate the issue Palestinian by imposing a new reality by force? Or is it just an attempt to explore international and regional reactions?
Political and specialized writers and analysts believe And university professors, in separate conversations of ""?"", that Trump's statements are not random, but may reflect a systematic policy aimed at changing the demographic map of the region, since the first day of his inauguration, Trump has talked about Gaza as an economic and investment project, not as a human and political issue, and this vision corresponds to With the extremist Israeli right plans, in preparation for the implementation of the ""Greater Israel"" project.
They confirm that Egypt categorically rejects any projects aimed at resettlement of the Palestinians on its soil, while Jordan faces great sensitivity to the issue of resettlement due to the presence of a large number of Palestinian refugees on its lands.
They see that the Palestinian people, who have survived the extermination and ethnic cleansing, will not give in to the threats of displacement, as the Palestinian issue is the issue of existence and identity, it will not be abandoned easily and will remain alive and no one will be able to liquidate it.

Trends rooted in the principles of Zionist Christianity

The professor of political media at Hebron University, Dr. Saeed Shaheen, confirms that the statements of US President Donald Trump regarding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict reveal his directions rooted in the principles of Zionist Christianity, which he clearly adopts.
Shaheen believes that these principles constitute the basis for behavior Trump, the politician, noting that everything that comes from it reflects the trends of the far -right, the extremist, and serves the demands of the biblical Zionism aimed at displacing the Palestinians, taking advantage of the state of Palestinian division and Arab dependency on the United States.
Shaheen believes that Trump's recent statements about the displacement of Palestinians to Jordan and Egypt come in the context of completing the projects that he failed to achieve during his first term, foremost of which is the acceleration of the pace of normalization between Israel and Arab countries through the Abrahamic agreements.
Shaheen notes that the ultimate goal of these projects is to fully liquidate the Palestinian issue, by strengthening normalization and swallowing more Palestinian and Arab lands.
These plans also aim, according to Shaheen, to implement the vision of the extreme Israeli right, represented by figures such as Bastel Smotrich and Etamar bin Ghafir, who seeks to empty the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Jerusalem from the Palestinians, in addition to the displacement of Palestinians inside, stressing that these policies seek to change the balance The demographic, which tends to be in favor of the Palestinians.
In a related context, Shaheen warns that these statements may threaten the sovereignty of Arab countries like Jordan And Egypt, noting that Trump's application is identified with the aspirations of the extremist Israeli right may lead to tense relations with these two countries, and perhaps fully blown them, stressing that the matter depends on the ability of Jordan and Egypt to face and thwart these plans.
Shaheen notes that these statements may be an opportunity for the Palestinian situation to achieve national unity, stressing that facing these crazy plans requires ending the Palestinian division and enhancing cohesion between different parties.
Shaheen praises the role of regional and international initiatives, such as the outputs of the Moscow, Algeria and Beijing meetings, in promoting Palestinian reconciliation, stressing that the success of the Palestinians in addressing these policies will be largely dependent on their ability to overcome their differences and unite their ranks.
Shaheen stresses that the American administration, in light of its regionally and internationally influence, is a dangerous tool in implementing the plans to liquidate the Palestinian issue.
Shaheen stresses that facing these policies requires a collective move from Arab and Islamic countries, in addition to the cohesion of the Palestinian ranks, to address any attempts aimed at undermining Palestinian rights and robbing more lands.

Repercussions Dangerous for Trump's statements

The writer and political analyst Mohamed Gouda warns of the serious repercussions of US President Donald Trump's statements, in which he called for the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Egypt and Jordan, stressing that these statements are not just a slip of tongue or passing statements, but rather a systematic policy aimed at changing the geographical and political reality In the region, and to complete the project that Trump started during his first term under the name ""Deal of the Century"".
Joudeh notes that Trump's statements come within the framework of a larger plan that aims to liquidate the Palestinian issue, by imposing a new reality by force, and re -drawing the demographic map of the region.
""Trump from the first day of his inauguration spoke about Gaza, its geographical location and its beautiful sea, as if he was looking at it as an economic and investment project, and not as a humanitarian and political issue,"" says Gouda.
Jouda confirms that these statements reveal serious orientations that have been previously disclosed through the ""Wickkes"" leaks, where US Vice President GD Verse spoke about a project to impose an American mandate on Gaza for 100 years, similar to the situation that Hong Kong was under British rule. ”
The quality confirms that such plans aim to Weakening the Palestinian presence, dropping the project of the Palestinian state, and ending the Palestinian issue completely.
On Egypt and Jordan's position on these statements, Gouda confirms that Cairo considers itself a guarantor of regional stability, and categorically rejects any projects aimed at resettlement of the Palestinians on its territory, whether in Sinai or others.
""Egypt always confirms its support for the two -state solution, and rejects any plans that threaten its national security or change the demographic map in the region.""
""Such statements may lead to tense relations between Cairo and Washington, especially if Egypt feels American pressure in this direction.""
As for Jordan, Jouda indicates that Jordan is facing great sensitivity to the issue of resettlement, in which a large number of Palestinian refugees live, and Jordan rejects any steps that add a new burden on it, and this may lead it to take a strict position towards the United States.
""King Abdullah II repeats his rejection of such solutions that exceed the national rights of the Palestinian people, and I expect that US sanctions will be imposed on Jordan as a result of his rejection of Trump's calls.""
The quality explains that Trump's statements aim to continue policies Liquidation of the Palestinian issue, by marginalizing the rights of the Palestinians to return, self -determination and establish the state.
""These statements strengthen the Palestinian feeling of no confidence in the international community, and ignite more anger towards American policies, especially after previous decisions such as moving the American embassy to Jerusalem,"" says Gouda.
Joudeh believes that such statements may lead to rearranging regional alliances, as the affected countries are converging of these ideas, such as Egypt and Jordan, to address them, as they will weaken calm efforts in Gaza, and may push to a greater escalation in the region as a result of the popular anger and resistance to these projects .
It calls for the unity of the Arab position, especially from Egypt and Jordan, to confront these plans targeting the Palestinian presence.
""A solid and solid Arab position is required to confront these dangerous statements, which aim to completely end the Palestinian issue,"" says Gouda.
The quality of the necessity of a unified and constant Palestinian position rejects any form of displacement, and emphasizes the right of the Palestinians to their land and homeland.
Joudeh stresses that the time has come to pressure by the international community on Israel, to recognize the Palestinian presence on this land, and on the right Establishing the Palestinian state on the borders of June 4, 1967, with Jerusalem as its capital.
""Israel must be obligated to implement all the laws and treaties approved by international legitimacy, which recognize the rights of the Palestinian people and their just cause, foremost of which is its right to self -determination and national independence.""
Gouda warns that Trump's statements, if they are not met with decisive responses from Egypt, Jordan and the international community, may lead to undermining efforts to bring peace, and the humanitarian and political situation in Palestine and the region as a whole.
Gouda confirms that the next with Trump will be worse, and will work to impose a new reality by force, which requires firm positions on all parties concerned.

A type of ""political fascism""

The writer and political analyst Sri Samour confirms that the recent statements of US President Donald Trump about the demand of Jordan and Egypt to receive the Palestinians can be considered a kind of ""political fascism"", indicating that they may not necessarily express an actual plan, but rather may aim to explore various reactions and test possible solutions To serve Israeli interests.
Samour explains that the primary goal of these statements is to push the parties The various, especially the Palestinians, to submit proposals that would mainly satisfy Israel.
""Trump sees himself more Israeli than the Israelis, and places the interest of Israel above all considerations, which is reflected in the nature of his proposal to deal with the region,"" says Samour.
Samour notes that the absence of clear plans or complete perceptions of post -statements is the prominent feature of these proposals.
Samour believes that ""even Israel itself lacks a clear perception of the next day, which appears in its previous failures, whether at the level of suggestions or procedures, such as staying in Natsarim, but Israel was forced to withdraw from it.""
Samour affirms the danger of using the reconstruction file as a pressure card and political extortion against the Palestinians, warning that the reconstruction of Gaza will be linked to conditions that harm the Palestinian national identity and resistance, and even to the entire Palestinian presence.
""This point specifically represents a great future threat, as Gaza's need for reconstruction can be used to force the Palestinians to accept plans aimed at undermining their national rights,"" said Samour.
On the impact of Trump's statements on American relations with the countries of the region, such as Egypt and Jordan, Samour confirms that the two countries are receiving Great American aid, making them vulnerable to Washington's pressure and extortion.
""It is not possible to predict how Egypt and Jordan respond to these proposals, especially in light of the continued American pressure,"" says Samour.
Nevertheless, Samour stresses that the real bet in facing these plans should be on the Palestinian people, specifically the people of Gaza, who are supposed to reject any attempts to pass these plans.
He says: ""Trump's statements, if they were implemented, are a clear threat to the Palestinian presence, and they are not limited to Gaza only, but may extend to the West Bank.""
Samour believes that these statements were supposed to pose a motivation to unify the Palestinians in the face of common threats, but it expresses his regret that there is no unified national strategy so far.
""Despite the bleeding blood in Gaza, we have not yet seen a joint national program to confront what is going on,"" says Samour. We hope that Trump's statements will pose a alarm that motivates everyone to join hands and develop a unified national plan, but unfortunately the indicators do not suggest this. ""

A project compatible between the Trump administration and the occupation government

The researcher specializing in Israeli affairs and conflict issues warns Nizar Nazzal of the seriousness of the US President's statements Donald Trump regarding the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, stressing that it is not just random statements but rather reflects an integrated project that has been agreed upon between the American administration led by Trump and the ruling class in Israel, led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Nazzal explains that Trump's statements regarding the displacement of the people of the Gaza Strip to the Sinai or Jordan are part of a major political plan that seeks to liquidate the Palestinian issue by forcibly displacing the population.
Nazzal notes that these statements are in harmony with the aspirations of the Israeli extremist right, which seeks to keep the historical geography of Palestine free of the Palestinians for the benefit of the Israelis, considering that Trump provides the ""Great Gift"" of Netanyahu in this context.
Nazzal believes that Trump, known for his nature as a businessman and coming from the heart of capitalism, deals with the Palestinian issue with the logic of deals, believing that the solution to the issue can only take place through the complete displacement of the Palestinians and granting Israel full control over the historical Palestinian territories.
Nazzal confirms that these ideas are not new, but rather an extension of previous projects such as ""the deal of the century"", which talked about residence An isolated Palestinian entity in Sinai.
Regarding the people of the Gaza Strip, Nazzal explains that Trump's statements indicate an American-Israeli consensus on the displacement of the Strip residents as a first step, in preparation for the move to talk about the displacement of the people of the West Bank.
Nazzal notes that this trend reflects an integrated plan to empty the sector of its people, invoking the reconstruction of Gaza or finding temporary solutions, while the real goal is to implement the forced displacement project.
And he confirms that this plan constitutes a great demographic threat to neighboring countries, especially Jordan, which currently includes a large percentage of the population of Palestinian descent, reaching 70 percent.
Nazzal explains that the displacement of more Palestinians to Jordan will significantly affect the demographic balance inside the Kingdom, which is a threat to its stability.
As for Egypt, Nazzal believes that the Egyptian state will stand with full force against this project, given the threat of Egyptian national and strategic security, stressing that Egypt, with its strong army and its accumulated diplomatic expertise, is able to address any attempts aimed at its security, indicating that Egypt will not allow the establishment of A Palestinian entity isolated on its soil in Sinai.
And in Concerning relations between the United States and the Arab countries, Nazzal explains that Trump's statements may lead to diplomatic drought between Washington and Egypt, but it is unlikely to reach the level of estrangement. As for Jordan, the relationship between the two countries will remain, given the size of their common interests, on Although limited tensions can occur.
Nazzal notes that Trump's statements coincide with his efforts to normalize relations between Israel and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which reflects an American-Israeli desire to provide assurances to the Saudi side regarding the solution of the Palestinian issue that the displacement will be temporary until the reconstruction is completed, even if it was at the expense of Palestinian rights.
Nazzal believes that Trump's statements are not only related to the Gaza Strip, but also touched on the inhabitants of the West Bank, where he spoke about Jordan clearly, indicating the intention to expand the circle of displacement in the future.
On the Palestinian level, Nazzal notes that Trump's statements reflect a threat to the Palestinian people, which calls for a comprehensive alert to confront it.
Nazzal confirms that the Palestinians categorically reject any plans aimed at forcibly displacing them, noting that the gradual return of the displaced to the north of the sector Gaza, despite the circumstances of extermination, reflects the will of the Palestinians to adhere to their land and refuse to get out of it.
Nazzal stresses that the Palestinian people realize that this displacement project represents an existential threat to them, whether in Gaza or the West Bank, and that confronting these plans requires a national cohesion and a unified position, indicating that the current Palestinian division constitutes a major obstacle to facing these challenges.
Nazzal confirms that the Palestinians are facing a real and serious danger that requires a comprehensive movement to confront it, calling for unifying Palestinian efforts and working to thwart these plans aimed at liquidating the Palestinian issue.
Nazzal notes that the coming years will be very difficult for the Palestinians, in light of the presence of a biased American administration that seeks to impose radical solutions to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, ignoring the national and historical rights of the Palestinian people.

Pressions of the Jewish lobby in the United States

The writer and political analyst Firas Yaghi warns that US President Donald Trump's statements, in which he called for the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to countries such as Egypt and Jordan, comes within the pressure from the Jewish lobby in the United States, especially The Zionist right, which fully supported Trump in the last elections.
Yaghi notes that these statements reflect the directions of the Trump administration regarding the Palestinian issue, but they remain part of the unclear plans until now, but all its indicators suggest that they do not correspond to the decisions of international legitimacy and the concept of a two -state solution.
Yaghi explains that Trump has already talked about the possibility of moving the Palestinians to other countries, including Indonesia, and not only Egypt and Jordan.
Yaghi describes Trump's recent statements as ""rude"", and aims to impose agendas that affect the sovereignty of Arab countries, especially the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the Arab Republic of Egypt.
Yaghi says: ""Trump is trying to pressure the two Arab states, but their rejectionist position was clear, and the Palestinian people who stood up to genocide, ethnic cleansing and daily killing will not give in to Trump's threats.""
Yaghi believes that Trump is trying through his statements to reformulate the concept of the Palestinian issue according to a new vision, focusing on reducing the population in the Gaza Strip, in line with the vision of his son -in -law Jared Kushner, who sees in Gaza an area that can be converted into a resort for multinationals or for investment in oil and gas in The Mediterranean Sea.
He says, ""Kushner imagines Gaza with a few residents working as workers, while the region is converted into an economic project that serves the interests of the multinational external forces,"" he says.
Yaghi asserts that the systematic destruction carried out by the extremist Benjamin Netanyahu government in Gaza was aimed at making the region not to live, in preparation for offering the idea of ??displacement of the population and the reconstruction of the region according to the American vision.
He says: ""Trump talks about the reconstruction of Gaza, but he wants to transport the Palestinian population, which is totally and detailed. The Palestinian people are the indigenous people of this land, and will not leave it under any circumstance.""
Yaghi notes that the Arab countries, especially Jordan and Egypt, categorically rejected any attempts to displace the Palestinians, saying: “The Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Al -Safadi affirmed that Jordan for Jordanians and Palestine for the Palestinians, and this is a clear and unambiguous position, and that Egypt refused to displace You realize that this means liquidating the Palestinian issue. ""
Yaghi asserts that these statements to Trump will not lead to tension in relations between the Arab countries and the United States, because they have not yet been presented as an official plan, but they will face a strong Arab refusal. If it is discussed in the Arab League, and the Arab peoples will even face it, and as the conspiracies of resettlement and military alliances have fallen, the Trump plot will fall.
Yaghi stresses that the Palestinian people, especially in the Gaza Strip, made great sacrifices to stay on their land, and will not be subjected to any attempts to displace.
Yaghi says: ""Whoever wants to displace the people of Gaza must know that they have presented what no one had previously presented in order to stick to their land, and the vast majority of the Palestinian people will remain sticking to their land.""
Yaghi believes that Trump is trying, through his statements, to intimidate the Arab countries, but he will not succeed in that.
He says: ""Trump speaks as if he was the strong man who is able to assume what he wants, but we saw how Jordan and Egypt rejected these ideas categorically, and the Palestinian people are the one who decides his fate, not Trump or any external force.""
Yaghi asserts that all the previous attempts to liquidate the Palestinian cause have been unsuccessful, and that Trump will go as others have gone, but the Palestinian people will remain and the Palestinian issue will remain alive, because immigration is not contained in the Palestinian dictionary, whoever dreams of returning and works for the return of return cannot migrate neither voluntarily or forcibly .",PS

He continued: «The arrival of the ceasefire agreement and the exchange of hostages and prisoners in the sector Gaza is only a first step in a long path towards achieving peace. This agreement came in a milestone in which the Palestinian people dwa the bitterness of siege, starvation and repression for more than fifteen months, in light of an international inability to face a serious threat to international peace and security. The Egyptian efforts, in cooperation with the sincere efforts of both the United States of America and the sister Qatar, came to prove once again that Egypt remains the beating heart of the issues of the Arab nation. From the first moment, Egypt has worked with dedication and sincerity to complete this agreement. The people of Gaza need it, however, we cannot lose sight of the great danger that the theses are represented regarding the displacement of Palestinians from their land. Jabali: “These ideas fully ignore the established truth that the Palestinian issue is not just a population issue or a geographical dispute, but rather the issue of a people who fights for their historical and legitimate rights. Is one imagining that the Palestinians, who presented thousands of martyrs, have sacrificed Expensive and precious, they can accept the abandonment of their land and their sanctities for any alternative. ”
He added, ""Everyone should realize that the Palestinian people are not just a group of people looking for shelter, but rather a people with an ancient history, a sacred land and an authentic right that does not fall into statute of limitations, and will never give up this right, and the Arab nation will not give up before it from this right.""
He added that the Egyptian parliament confirms that such theses, which are trying to circumvent the rights of the Palestinian people, are not limited to threatening the Palestinians alone, but rather a serious threat to regional security and stability; Because it may cause obstruction of the efforts of the current armistice sustainability and its arrival to a permanent ceasefire. This is in addition to that the displacement of Palestinians means the possibility of transferring the conflict to other lands, with the catastrophic repercussions of this region.
""Jabali"" stressed that the Egyptian parliament categorically rejects any arrangements or attempts to change the geographical and political reality of the Palestinian issue, because such policies did not in the past except to deepen the crisis and perpetuate injustice.

This goal will only be achieved by launching a serious and comprehensive political process, which includes enabling the Palestinian National Authority to carry out its tasks in Gaza and the West Bank, and supporting reconstruction projects and the flow of humanitarian aid.

Palestinian leaders, political analysts, and academics emphasized that the rearrangement of the Palestinian House is the main factor in making a real shift in the map of the conflict, not only the Saudi or Arab position. The restoration of the Palestine Liberation Organization for its role, the unification of the Palestinian ranks within a collective leadership, and the adoption of a clear national strategy to confront the occupation, is the main key to any strategic change, as the absence of the Palestinian act will lead to the dedication of the Israeli reality.
At the same time, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stands out as an active regional power that has a major impact on supporting the issue The Palestinian politically and diplomatically, as its solid position in rejecting normalization without establishing a Palestinian state, and rejecting the displacement plans, strengthens the Arab and international position, which makes it a major player in confronting Israeli plans. However, the success of any Arab or international effort depends on the active internal Palestinian action, to ensure that Saudi and Arab support is investing in achieving tangible results on the ground.


Strategic support for the Palestinian issue

Dr. Mahmoud Al -Habbash, adviser to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said in an exclusive interview with ""Jerusalem"" that the Saudi position rejecting normalization with Israel without establishing an independent Palestinian state represents a corner stone in strengthening the Arab position and strengthening the Palestinian position in the face of attempts to liquidate the Palestinian issue. He explained that Saudi Arabia is not a marginal state, but rather a ""pivotal state in the Arab, Islamic, regional and international system"", which makes its position a profound impact in determining the path of the Palestinian issue at the Arab and international levels.
Al -Habbash added that the stability and clarity of the Saudi position constitutes a source of strength for the Palestinians, especially in light of the leadership of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, where he stressed However, the Kingdom ""rejects any form of relationship with Israel, unless this is through a fair political solution in accordance with international legitimacy decisions, ensuring the end of the occupation and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with its capital, Jerusalem, a continuous and viable country, free of occupation and settlement.""

Addressing attempts to displace and promote Palestinian resilience

Regarding the extremist Israeli calls aimed at displacing the Palestinians, Al -Habbash stressed the importance of taking practical steps at the Palestinian level to face these challenges, noting that the first of these steps is ""the return of the Palestinian National Authority to the Gaza Strip, which sends a clear message that the Palestinian land is one, under One political leadership, within one country and a unified political region. ""
He explained that ""strengthening the steadfastness of citizens in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank is the key to confronting any attempts to deport the Palestinians from their land,"" stressing that this steadfastness must be supported by the basic ingredients .
He pointed out that the unified Arab position is one of the most important factors for thwarting the displacement plan, as he stressed that ""the positions It was expressed by His Majesty King Abdullah II, President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi, and the official Saudi position all came with a categorical rejection of any attempt to deport the Palestinians or liquidate their cause, ""stressing that this Arab cohesion, which is fully harmonious with the Palestinian stability, constitutes a strong wall in the face of These plans added, ""We are sure that we can thwart this scheme, and we will fail it as we have failed other attempts to liquidate the Palestinian issue.""

Investing Saudi support in the international movement

As for investing the Saudi position at the international level, Al -Habbash stressed that ""the international position is essentially based on the Arab position, which makes the unified Arab position a driving force in international forums to support the rights of Palestinians."" He explained that the Palestinian movements in international organizations depend on Arab support, Saying: ""We are moving a pure Palestinian move, but we also move within the framework of a Palestinian -Arab Palestinian move, because the fixed Arab position is the pillar of the situation The international, and we definitely benefit from it in mobilizing international support for our cause and our international legitimacy.
At the end of his speech, Al -Habbash stressed that ""the Saudi position It represents a strategic opportunity that must be built Palestinian and Arab to face the current challenges, ""stressing that Palestinian unity and Arab cohesion are the only way to thwart attempts to impose forced solutions that ignore legitimate Palestinian rights.

The arrangement of the Palestinian house is the key to the real shift in the conflict

For his part, Professor of Political Science, Dr. Ahmed Jamil Azam that the real shift in the map of the conflict will not be the result of a Saudi or Arab position as much as it is subject to the internal Palestinian and the rearrangement of the Palestinian house.
Azam stressed that ""the basic variable that may re -draw the equation of the conflict is to rearrange the Palestinian house, restore the Palestine Liberation Organization to its primary role, and the return of the Palestinian national movement to play its natural role.""
He stressed that ""the absence of the collective leadership and the freezing of the energies of the Palestinian people will not lead to any transformation, but rather the Palestinians will remain between two cases: either the place to be wasting and wasting opportunities, or surrendering to an Israeli reality that is deteriorating.""
He added: ""The reality of the Israeli, the Israeli, does not wait for anyone. If the Palestinians do not resist, and there is no organized national action, then the Israeli side will not He stops imposing new facts on the ground, ""stressing that"" sufficiency in the role of maintaining security and adapting to Israeli policies without a clear national plan to confront the occupation will be a devastating matter. ""

The Saudi position .. its roots and dimensions after October 7

On the reasons for the Saudi position rejecting normalization without a fair solution to the Palestinian cause, Aziz indicated that this position is not new, but rather due to the events of October 7, as there were efforts to reach a group of regional understandings that were not in the essence of Saudi -Israeli, but rather it was going on On a joint defense agreement between Saudi Arabia and the United States.
""Before October 7, it was not the talk about a Saudi -Israeli normalization agreement, but rather about the rearrangement of American -Saudi relations, as there was a talk about signing covenants and agreements between the two countries, and its pass in Congress required the approval of the Israeli lobby, so it was not normalization A goal in itself, but it was a way to facilitate this process, but the Saudi party required a solution to satisfy the Palestinians before proceeding with any understandings.
He added, ""But the events of October 7 stopped these endeavors and rearranged the priorities, as Trump's arrival came to make a shift Another in the scene. While Biden was seeking to put forward a new perception to rearrange the Saudi -American relations, through initiatives such as the ""Green Corridor"" that was supposed to link India to Europe through the Gulf and Israel, Trump ""does not carry an integrated strategic perception of the region, but rather it is preferred to deal with each Individually state. ""

The Saudi position and its potential impact on facing the Trump plan
On the impact of the Saudi position in the face of the American and Israeli trends, Azam sees that ""the Saudi position will have an important impact, especially if it crystallizes within a unified Arab position that includes Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the UAE,"" noting that the expected Arab summit on the 27th of this month will be a detailed station, adding That ""if the Arab summit comes out with a unified position that categorically rejects the Trump plan, this will be a big step towards stopping the deterioration in the Palestinian issue.""
He also pointed out that Saudi Arabia played an important role alongside Jordan and other countries in pushing some European countries, such as Spain and Norway, to recognize the Palestinian state, which reflects the role it can play at the diplomatic level and international relations in pressure in favor of rights Palestinian.
However, despite the importance of this role, it is determined that ""the main dilemma still lies in the situation on the ground inside the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and the rest of Palestine. Without a serious internal Palestinian move, any Arab or international position will remain insufficient to achieve a real change.""
He added: ""The Saudi and Arab position can help to stop the deterioration, but the root solution begins from the Palestinian interior. What is required today is to rearrange the Palestinian house, unify the ranks, and adopt a clear national strategy to confront the occupation. Without that, the Palestinians will remain in the reaction position instead of To be an active party to formulate their political future. ""

The maximum priority rearranged the Palestinian house

At the end of his speech to ""Al -Quds"", Azam stressed that any transformations on the regional and international arena, no matter how impressive, will not be sufficient without a real Palestinian initiative to rearrange the internal house, reunify the Palestinian leadership within the PLO, and activate the role of the factions in a comprehensive national framework. .
The intention believes that ""the real change will not come from abroad, but from the Palestinian interior. If the Palestinians do not unite, and they did not adopt a comprehensive national vision, then the occupation is The Israeli will continue to impose his facts, and Arab and international efforts will remain within the framework of reducing damage, not a strategic change in favor of the Palestinians.


The Saudi position changes the balance of the conflict and gives the Arabs a strategic opportunity
The Director General of the Palestinian Center for Policy Research and Strategic Studies, ""Masara"", spoke to ""Al -Quds"" about the Saudi position rejecting normalization with Israel without establishing an independent Palestinian state, and its opposition to the plans of displacement and annexation, pointing out that this position constitutes a ""decisive turning point in equations Regional and international.
Al -Masry explained that ""Riyadh has become more capable of political maneuvering, and less dependent on the United States, which gave it a broader space to take decisions that reflect its independence and regional position.""
Al -Masry emphasized that international and regional transformations played a fundamental role in Saudi Arabia's taking this solid position, explaining that ""Saudi Arabia is not just an ordinary country, but a central regional power that enjoys economic, political and religious weight, which makes its positions a great impact at the international level.
He added: What is presented is American and Israeli today, affects the sovereignty and independence of Saudi Arabia, which is something It is more than possible, and the international environment has changed, and the United States is no longer absolutely dominant on the international system. It is true that it is still the first country globally, but the distance between it and China is shrinking quickly, especially in some areas in which Beijing outperformed Washington. This change gave Saudi Arabia, and to Arab countries in general, a wider field of maneuvering and more independent positions. ""
Al -Masry pointed out that Saudi Arabia ""is no longer in the same political position that it was during the first Trump state,"" explaining that Prince Muhammad bin Salman, during that period, was seeking ""to confirm his political legitimacy amid great pressure, most notably the issue of the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, what He made it more open to cooperating with Washington at the time. Today, the situation is completely different, as Riyadh has strengthened its relations with China with investments exceeding $ 120 billion, and strengthened its cooperation with Russia, and also improved its relations with Iran after the agreement that was sponsored by Chinese in Beijing, which reduced its need for American and Israeli support.

Saudi Arabia refuses to prejudice its role and prestige

Al -Masry stressed that the recent regional events, ""like the Israeli war on Gaza and Lebanon, and what It was followed by calls for the displacement of the Palestinians and the annexation of the West Bank, which posed a direct threat to the role of Saudi Arabia and its regional prestige. In addition, the improvement of relations with Iran, and the decline in American influence, are all factors that have contributed to reducing Saudi Arabia's need for American and Israeli protection, what She was allowed to take a more balanced and independent position. ""

The Saudi position and its impact on international alliances

On the impact of this position on the balance of global powers, Al -Masry believes that ""Saudi Arabia's rejection of the plans for displacement and annexation, and the enormous economic influence it has, may lead the American administration to reconsider its policies,"" noting that Trump, who is considered a ""man with deals and not an ideological man He may decline if he feels that his decisions will affect his deals.
He added: ""If Saudi Arabia decides to use its power papers, such as its huge investments, which range from 600 billion to a trillion dollars, as a means of pressure against attempts to displace Palestinians or include the West Bank, this will put the administration. The American is in a real dilemma, ""stressing that these"" are not just theoretical bets, but rather a political reality based on clear economic accounts. ""
But Al -Masry stressed that the success of this pressure is ""dependent on the extent of the ability of the Arab countries to invest the Saudi position and not be satisfied with denunciation and condemnation as happened in previous times,"" explaining that ""if the Arab countries adopt effective policies based on economic and political interests, and not just refusal data, then it is lost You can pressure the American administration to adjust its position on the Palestinian issue. But if it continues with the same traditional approach, Trump will go on his way without hesitation. ""

A real test of Arab unity

With regard to the upcoming Arab summit at the end of the current month, Al -Masry indicated that it ""constitutes a real test of the Arab position, as it can be a turning point towards"" opening a new page in the Arab role, or staying within the framework of decisions that remain mere ink on paper "", stressing that There is a ""real opportunity to take a unified and influential Arab position, provided that the summit precedes an internal Palestinian compatibility.""
He pointed out that ""the summit can unite the Palestinians, but the Palestinians themselves must take a step towards autism before its convening To ensure positive results. The next Arab summit can unite them if it wants, but Saudi Arabia and the Arab countries can impose Palestinian unity as a strategic necessity. Hamas is fully aware that the absence of Palestinian and Arab legitimacy makes its situation more complicated. ""

A historical opportunity that must be invested

In conclusion, Al -Masry stressed that ""the Saudi position constitutes a decisive turning point in the map of the conflict in the Middle East, and provides the Arab countries an opportunity to enhance their role in protecting the rights of Palestinians,"" stressing that ""what we are witnessing today is a milestone, either the Arab countries invest this position and restore Draw the conflict equation, or miss the opportunity as happened in previous stations. The options are still open, but what is certain is that the regional and international scene is no longer the same as It was, and that the Saudi position has become a factor that cannot be overcome in any future political equation.

Saudi Arabia is a leading diplomatic force in rejecting displacement and normalization

In turn, the Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates for United Nations and its specialized organizations, Dr. Omar Awadallah, in an interview with ""Jerusalem"" that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia plays a pivotal role in defending the Palestinian issue, both at the Arab level Or Islamic or international, noting that its position rejecting normalization without establishing an independent Palestinian state, and its conclusive opposition to forced displacement plans, enhances the Palestinian, Arab and international position in the face of Israeli policies.
Awadallah explained that Saudi Arabia is not only a sister country for Palestine, but also the head of the Arab and Islamic Summit, and an active member of the League of Arab States and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, in addition to its great role as a major player in the Gulf region and the international scene.
He added: Its role in defending the Palestinian issue extends to various international forums, as the ministerial committee that roamed the world's capitals headed to mobilize support for the Palestinian issue, especially in light of the war of constant genocide against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip for more than 15 months.
He pointed out that the Saudi position ""contributed to enabling the Arab position, which strengthened international positions that reject displacement and liquidation, stressing that the political path and stability in the Middle East region is closely related to the existence of an internationally recognized Palestinian state.""

Refuse for forced displacement and strengthening the unity of the Palestinian ranks

On the Palestinian measures to confront the displacement, Awadallah stressed that ""the strong link between the Palestinian position and the Arab and Islamic positions enhances the solidity of the Palestinian rejection since the beginning of the Israeli aggression, as the Palestinian leadership has been clear since the first day that Israeli intentions aim to exterminate the Palestinian people and impose forced displacement.""
He added: ""The upcoming Arab summit on the 27th of this month constitutes an important opportunity to take a clear and direct Arab position, not only to reject the displacement plans, but also to develop real alternatives based on the right of the Palestinian people, based on international law, and Arab and Islamic constants.""
Awadallah explained that this move will extend from the Arab summit to the emergency ministerial meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and then to the United Nations, whether in the General Assembly or in the Security Council, in conjunction with the convening of the Human Rights Council session that will start on the 24th of this month, noting that These efforts will enhance the international position rejecting displacement and ethnic cleansing, and intensifying accountability and accountability for Israel for its crimes, based on international and court laws. International criminal.

Diplomatic and political support is decisive

With regard to investment The Saudi position in international pressure against attempts to normalize and displacement, Awadallah stressed that Saudi Arabia said its word clearly, which is the same word that expresses the position of the Arab and Islamic nation that the forced displacement of the Palestinians constitutes a direct threat to Arab national security, which is rejected altogether and in detail.
He said: ""This solid Saudi stance strengthens the international position, and makes any Israeli move towards implementing the displacement plans as a real threat to international legitimacy, which pushes the accountability of Israel if it carried out these crimes.""
The Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs stressed that Saudi Arabia once again proved that it is a regional force that leads Arab and Islamic positions, and established the principle of defending Palestine as a central issue. He pointed out that ""the Saudi position was fast and decisive, as soon as the press conference in which Israel announced its plans, the official Saudi statement was present in public and on all media platforms, which reflects the Kingdom's commitment to its historical role.""
He added: Saudi Arabia is not only a partner in supporting the Palestinian issue, but it is also the leader of the global coalition to implement a two -state solution, as it is preparing to head the international conference that will be held in Next June, in cooperation with France, with the aim of pushing efforts towards a fair political settlement, based on the implementation of United Nations resolutions and the two -state solution.
He continued: ""When Saudi Arabia speaks, it speaks as a global force affecting the international decision, and therefore its clear and decisive position in supporting Palestine and rejecting displacement and normalization without establishing a Palestinian state, enhances Palestinian diplomatic efforts, and puts Israel in front of a historical responsibility that cannot be exceeded.""

A fixed Saudi position that reflects a real commitment to the Palestinian issue

At the end of his speech, Awadallah stressed that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia proves day by day that it is a key partner in defending Palestinian rights, and that it is at the forefront of diplomatic efforts to find a just and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian issue.
He said: ""Saudi Arabia is not just a political supporter, but rather a diplomatic force that leads real efforts at the Arab and international levels, and it is upon its responsibility to defend Palestine, not only by speaking, but indeed and the rapid move. This makes its position not just a political position, but part of An Arab and international defense system that protects the rights of Palestinians and faces threats to their presence.",PS

Abdel -Ati explained that there is a full Arab consensus on this issue, stressing the need to respect the rights of the Palestinian people to stay on and adhere to their land.
The meeting, which came within the framework of strengthening the strategic partnership between Egypt and the United States, dealt with ""the Egyptian efforts to achieve security and stability in the Middle East.""

It is scheduled to discuss initial ideas during a meeting in Riyadh this month, in which Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, and the Emirates participated in February 20. Five of the sources said that the proposals may include the reconstruction fund led by the Gulf states and an agreement to remove the enthusiastic movement.
According to ""Reuters"", Saudi Arabia and its allies are in the Arab region in a state of panic from the Trump plan ""to purify"" Gaza from the Palestinians and resettle most of them in Jordan and Egypt, a proposal that Cairo and Amman rejected immediately, and most of the countries of the region are seen by it that will destabilize it strongly.
The aforementioned sources added that ""the dismay exacerbates Saudi Arabia because the plan will involve the Kingdom's request for a clear path to the Palestinian state as a condition for normalizing relations with Israel, which would also pave the way for an ambitious military agreement between Riyadh and Washington, which in turn will enhance the Kingdom's defense systems in Facing Iran, ""according to"" Reuters.

Reuters also added that 15 sources in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan talked about the relevant efforts made by Arab countries to put the existing proposals in a new plan that can be marketed to the American president, with no exclusion of the probability of calling them the ""Trump plan"" to win his approval. It also quoted an Arab government source that at least four proposals have already been formulated about the future of Gaza, but an Egyptian proposal currently appears to be the basis for the Arab endeavor towards creating an alternative to the idea of ??Trump.
Regarding the Egyptian proposal to confront the Trump plan to displace Gaza, three Egyptian security sources told Reuters that the latest Egyptian proposal includes the formation of a Palestinian committee to rule the Gaza Strip without the participation of Hamas, and international cooperation in reconstruction without the displacement of the Palestinians, in addition to the proceeding Towards a two -state solution. While an Arab government source explained that representatives of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the Emirates and Qatar, in addition to the Palestinians (5+1), will review and discuss the plan in Riyadh before it is presented at the Arab Summit scheduled to be held on February 27. The Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, will seem to play a major role, according to Reuters. From Jordan, the agency quoted itself from a source as saying: ""We say to the Americans that we have a practical plan. Our meeting with Muhammad bin Salman will be decisive. It leads efforts.""
Earlier this month, well -informed Arab diplomatic sources revealed to ""Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed"" that an emergency Arab summit will be held in Cairo on the 27th of this month, to discuss ways to confront the Trump plan, and to formulate a unified Arab position that supports Egypt and Jordan regarding the expected pressures, in addition to discussing the situation Humanity, the future of the sector, and the total developments of the Palestinian issue.

While the plan received an Israeli welcoming, the Prime Minister of the occupation government, Benjamin Netanyahu, made statements that sparked a Saudi anger, calling for the establishment of a Palestinian state in Saudi Arabia in response to Riyadh's requirement for any normalization with Israel to establish a Palestinian state. Netanyahu also attacked Egypt and accused it of turning the Gaza Strip into an open prison.

The Middle East represents an important and basic region in the world, so how will the policy of US President -elect Donald Trump in this region be with his return to the presidency of the United States?
Trump is different from most American presidents in modern history in his way of working and dealing with the period of two and a half months that separate his election and actually assuming power and entering the White House on January 20.
Trump has already started to intervene in foreign policy files since his election on the fifth of November. The Middle East was at the forefront of Trump's interests.
Trump had promised during his campaign to end the wars that broke out after the end of his first term. When he was elected as a president, he launched his famous statement that the gates of hell would open in the Middle East if the hostages were not released and the shooting stopped in Gaza.
Trump has repeated his statement more than once, citing Hamas by name, but he was not limited to it, but also a possibility that it would include hell that threatens him with other parties.

This threat played a major role in reaching the ceasefire agreement in Gaza, which the President's administration tried Joe Biden reached him, but her efforts have failed for almost a year. But Trump also put pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who and his government had objections to the formulas and details of the agreement in the past. Trump sent his own east envoy Steve and Takouf to participate in the negotiations, and to meet directly he was decisive with Netanyahu in the days before reaching the agreement.
The post -agreement stage will be very important and will be largely dependent on Israel's directions and Trump's positions.

With the ceasefire, the region will face major questions, the most prominent of which is the way in which the Gaza Strip will be grabbed, the fate of Hamas and its future, and other questions that will of course lead to the most important file in terms of regional powers, which is Iran's file.
In this file, two large parties: The first is the Iranian nuclear program, and this is a red line that is unlikely that Trump allows Iran to cross it towards a nuclear weapon. the plan Options for Israeli military intervention and perhaps even American.
The other side in the issue of Iran and Trump's policy with it is the regional influence of Tehran. This influence was subjected to major strikes following the Israeli war with Hezbollah and the fall of Bashar al -Assad's rule, and Trump will now come with his policy known to the maximum pressure on Iran, but with a new more strict version, this will mean that Iraq with its Iranian -backed armed groups, and its American -backed government, but allied with Iran, It will be a major square to follow the extent of Trump's pressure on Iran and its resistance.
Yemen is also very important, as Trump will inherit half a war that the Biden administration started against the Houthis without achieving its goals in stopping their threat to maritime navigation near the Bab al -Mandab Strait or their missile bombing on Israel.
Trump has put the Houthis on the terrorist list in the last days of his previous presidential term, but the Biden administration removed them from it in order to deal with the de facto of the Houthis' control over an essential part of Yemen. Trump may return the Houthis to that list, and may change the strategy of military strikes against them to a more effective style.
Trump will seek to strengthen Iran's decline in Lebanon, where a new president, Joseph Aoun, was elected and agreed on a new prime minister, Nawaf Salam, both of whom were not the preferred option for Hezbollah.

As for Syria, the situation has changed completely before Trump's arrival, its new administration led by Ahmed Al -Shara is looking for good relations with everyone, and Turkey has a great role. Trump certainly talked about him in a way that accepts interpretation, but confirms that he is heading to understand with him.
In his first presidency, Trump tried to withdraw from eastern Syria in exchange for an agreement that expands the influence of Turkey at the expense of the US -backed Kurdish leadership, which controls the east of the Euphrates River.
This file will also be open to Trump, especially since the military presence in Syria is interconnected with the American military presence in neighboring Iraq, and this is due to the war days of organizing what is known as the ""Islamic State"", which Trump considers to defeat and wants to fold the page.
Trump may not resort to abandoning the allies from the Kurds of Syria, but he will most likely make decisions related to the American military presence in Iraq and Syria, and the relationship to Iran is an opponent, and Turkey is an ally.
Relationships are expected to strengthen America, with its traditional allies in the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Egypt, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Jordan. Trump is known for its focus on America's direct interests, especially security and economic, without focusing on files such as the record of some allies in the field of human rights.
As for Sudan, the Biden administration punished in its recent days the poles of the conflict there, the commander of the army, Abdel -Fattah al -Burhan, and his opponent, the commander of the Rapid Support Forces, Muhammad Hamdan Daglo (Hamidati), accusing them of responsibility for war and violations against civilians.
Sudan does not usually represent an essential file in American interest, but the size of the tragedy left by the civil war and the fact that Sudan is involved in the normalization agreements achieved by the previous Trump administration makes it an important file for Trump, which cherishes these agreements and is now promising to expand them.
The expansion of normalization agreements means Saudi Arabia, with its economic, political and religious weight, any agreement between it and Israel that will mean a tremendous diplomatic achievement for Trump, but Saudi Arabia has great demands in exchange for this major step, which includes the development of a Saudi nuclear program and will also include most likely guarantees by the establishment of a Palestinian state.
The side will remain The economist is strongly present in Trump's Middle East policy, especially in his relations with the Gulf states. If the Biden administration strategy has been based on managing competition with China, Trump will seek to make clear progress at the expense of Beijing, especially in the Middle East.",UK

"The statements of US President Donald Trump during his meeting caused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a sensation in the Palestinian, Arab and Islamic circles, after his clear talk about his desire to control the Gaza Strip. Trump spoke, during his meeting with Netanyahu, on the evening of yesterday, Tuesday, clearly about the displacement of Palestinians from the Strip and their transfer to several countries, in addition to the fact that Trump's plans on Gaza will lead to America's full control of the Strip, in confirmation of his previous statements regarding the displacement, which I had a wide Palestinian and regional rejection, especially by Egypt and Jordan. Trump's plans over Gaza are intersecting with the vision of the Israeli right and extremist nationalist currents that want to displace the people of the Gaza and the Palestinians in general and enhance settlement in Gaza, the West Bank and the occupied Jerusalem. This vision is supported by the Israeli Finance Minister of Smotrich and the resigned national security minister, Etamar bin Afir, who have been calling since the beginning of the war on Gaza for the necessity of settlement in the Strip and the deportation of its people.

The effect of Trump's plans on Gaza on the ceasefire
It is afraid that these statements will have repercussions on a state of stopping The freshener shooting in Gaza, in light of the Israeli delay in introducing relief aid and implementing the human protocol that was agreed upon during the first stage of the agreement. The fate of the second stage of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza appears unknown in light of the current American vision, as it is certain that the Hamas movement and the resistance factions in general reject any talk about voluntary or forced displacement of the Palestinians. Moreover, the position of the Palestinian Authority and the Fatah movement does not seem far from the position of Hamas and the factions allied to it, as well as the Arab position that definitely rejects Trump's plans on Gaza, which will lead to the displacement of Palestinians towards these countries.

Jihad Taha: Trump's plans give legitimacy to the occupation in its devastating aggression on the Gaza Strip

As for internally, the Palestinian factions in general do not have any political vision to reach a joint agreement between them on a political work program that addresses Trump's plans on Gaza, which requires the displacement of Palestinians outside the Strip. The displacement was from the first days of the war on the 471 -day sector, but the occupation failed to implement it by military force, while Netanyahu and Trump wanted Currently by implementing it with soft political projects and tools. The Palestinians are counting on their steadfastness and their survival on their land to address Trump's plans on Gaza, but this collides with the destruction of Trump to wave his new project under the pretext that the sector has turned into a geographical area for demolition only. The spokesman for Hamas, Jihad Taha, says that Trump's plans on Gaza are in the context of the century deal, projects and displacement plans that the American administration seeks targeting the Palestinian people, especially in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.

Q/C | What do we know until the moment of Trump's plan to control the Gaza Strip?

In an interview with ""Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed"", Taha added, commenting on Trump's plans on Gaza, that the Palestinian people with all its national, Islamic and mass components reject these statements and consider them a clear bias to the occupation. He points out that these statements give legitimacy to the occupation in its destructive aggression on the Gaza Strip, stressing that the Palestinian people are adhering to their land and rights and no one can impose their dictates on him and the fate of these projects will be failure and fall. Taha stresses the necessity of all efforts at the Palestinian national level to confront these projects, as has become A required from the international community, the Arab League, and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the urgent action, respect for the will of the Palestinian people and their aspirations to live in dignity on their land, stop the policy of committing crimes and massacres against their right, enhancing its steadfastness, and addressing the effects of aggression on the Gaza Strip.

Fatah: The sector is part of the Palestinian state
In addition, a spokesman for the Fatah movement, Munther Al -Hayek, confirms his categorical movement, US control over the Strip, stressing that the sector is an integral part of the Palestinian state, and who will rule it are the Palestinians and the leadership that the Palestinian people will choose themselves. Al -Hayek tells Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed that his movement suggests to Trump to implement the UN resolution 194 (issued in the year 1948), which provides for the return of the Palestinians to their lands from which they abandoned in 1948, which will constitute a solution for the refugee Palestinians from the Strip by returning to their lands. He adds that these statements and plans are fully rejected, and they will fail as plans have failed over the years and decades in displacing the Palestinians from their lands outside, whether to Arab countries or others. Al -Hayek notes that the only solution is the clear political path through international legitimacy decisions, especially Decisions regarding the Palestinian issue, along with the Arab initiative that was launched in 2002, which provides for the Israeli withdrawal from the territories occupied in 1976, including Jerusalem.


Ahmed Al -Tanani: Trump's plans are identical to the vision of the national religious movement in the occupying country

For his part, the director of the Arabba Center for Research and Strategic Studies, Ahmed Al -Tanani, believes that Trump's plans on Gaza are identical and consistent with the vision of the national religious movement in the occupying state, which wants to carry out the displacement and restoration of settlement. Al -Tanani tells Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed that Trump has completely adopted the visions of the religious right in Israel, which is a renovation of the Israeli displacement plans, which essence essence to transfer the Palestinians from the entire lands in it in order to complete the Israeli presence on the entire historic area of ??Palestine. He explains that what is happening represents a precedent within the framework of American support for the Israeli occupation, which requires a Palestinian to agree on a comprehensive confrontation project, as targeting is not limited to the sector only, but also includes the entire Palestinian issue.

Trump's plan on Gaza is provoking Shock: An Arab and international rejection and an Israeli welcome

Al -Tanani notes that this project goes beyond the project of the century deal that Trump previously put forward in his first term in 2017, and he goes away in his vision to liquidate the entire Palestinian issue by displacing the Palestinians abroad and ending the presence of the Palestinian people as a population and entity. Al -Tanani notes the necessity of a Palestinian agreement on the wide popular confrontation and political and diplomatic confrontation. In addition, it is required to perform the broadest Arab compatibility process, as the matter will pay for all Arabs, as Israeli ambition includes parts of Egypt and Jordan, and it may reach parts of the Arabian Peninsula. Al -Tanani confirms that the American president deals with files according to the winning deals and in the manner of ""businessmen"", and therefore if he knows that American interests will be in danger due to this project, this will contribute to thwarting all plans, the condition of Palestinian and Arab consensus.

Trump exceeds the deal of the century
For his part, the director of the Masarat Center for Research and Studies, Hani Al -Masry, believes that Trump exceeded in his statements his previous vision he presented in 2017, which was known at the time of the name The deal of the century, and it is in line with the vision of Smotrich and Ben Ghafir. Al -Masry tells Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed that what is required is a joint Palestinian national work program, even with the minimum compatibility between the Fatah and Hamas movements, which leads to strengthening the steadfastness of the Palestinian people and cutting the way for the Trump project. He notes that displacement and resettlement projects are not the first, but the danger lies in the current circumstances, which requires work with countries such as Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia to address these projects during the current period. Al -Masry is likely that Trump's plans on Gaza negatively reflect on the second and third phases of the ceasefire agreement, especially what is the reconstruction and the attempt to link them with the transportation of the population outside the Strip. It indicates that the recent statements are a green light in order to eliminate the Palestinian resistance and complete the war of extermination on the Strip, even with the end of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza. Al -Masry notes that the displacement project is not limited to the residents of the Strip, but may affect the existence of the Palestinian Authority itself, and pushing its entire collapse in the occupied West Bank, as it became clear that Trump is in its second era. Worse than it was in its first edition in the ruling.

"The leaders of African countries continue their meetings that started yesterday, Saturday, and will continue today, Sunday, in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, during the annual African Union Summit, in the absence of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi, who was delegated by Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouly. The opening session witnessed the presence of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and the Secretary -General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres, along with a number of African leaders.

With the 38th summit of the African Union, Egypt finds itself in front of hot regional files that require, according to experts, and an active response and active diplomacy. The escalating tensions in the Horn of Africa, the continuation of the war in Sudan, the Renaissance Dam crisis, and the turmoil in the African coast and Libya are all issues that put Egyptian foreign policy in a real test. Cairo seeks to preserve its regional interests and protect its national security in the face of geical transformations that may reshape the African scene. During the opening session of the summit, yesterday, the African Union Summit for the year 2025, headed by Angola, which took over the presidency of the Union to succeed Mauritania. Also announced by the membership of the Federation Office The African, which consists of five member states representing the various African regions, is a body that plays an essential role in supporting the works of the Union.

Egypt's challenges during the African Union Summit
But this summit comes at a very difficult time for Egypt, as Cairo faces unprecedented challenges at the level of national security. In addition to African crises, the summit coincides with the war in Gaza, which constitutes a direct threat to the stability of the region, especially with its repercussions on Egyptian security. The American administration's plan to displace the Palestinians, according to US President Donald Trump's proposals, is raising existential concerns for Egypt, threatening to create a new reality that may lead to the reshaping of population and geographical balances in the entire region. This places Egyptian diplomacy in front of a double challenge to face international pressure on this issue, and at the same time, maintaining its strong presence within the African Union.

The Horn of Africa is witnessing an escalation in tensions, especially between Somalia, Ethiopia and Eritrea, after Ethiopia signed an agreement with Somalia Land (Somaliland region), in March 2024, granting it a marine outlet across a port on the sea Red, in exchange for recognition of the region, which sparked angry reactions from Mogadishu. This move may cause transformations in the balance of power in the region, which requires an active diplomacy to protect stability and enhance its historical relations with the countries of the region. Through the current summit, Cairo can push towards a political framework that guarantees respect for the national sovereignty of African countries, and prevents conflicts from escalation.

During the summit, Cairo pushed a comprehensive political solution that restores stability to Sudan

As for Sudan, it is a major strategic importance for Egypt, but the continuation of the conflict between the Sudanese army and the rapid support forces enhances instability and threatens the unity of the Sudanese state. With the exacerbation of the humanitarian situation and the displacement of millions, Egypt continues its diplomatic efforts to contain the conflict through international and regional mediation. According to information available to Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed, Cairo pushed during the African summit to find a comprehensive political solution that restores stability to Sudan and preserves its land unit, by communicating with all relevant parties. The Ethiopian Renaissance Dam file is a constant concern for Egypt, as Addis Ababa continues its unilateral policy regarding filling And the operation of the dam without a binding legal agreement, which was also present in the Egyptian talks in Addis Ababa. Besides, the Entebby Agreement (for the Nile River Basin countries was concluded in 2010) as one of the thorny files, as some Nile Basin countries seek to redistribute water shares in a way that may harm the interests of Egypt and Sudan. Egyptian diplomatic sources confirmed to Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed that the African summit came as an important platform that Cairo used to reaffirm its historical rights in the waters of the Nile, and demanding a fair African mechanism that guarantees not to harm the water interests of the affected countries.

During the past years, Cairo has provided great support for its candidates in the leadership positions of the Federation, which reflects its commitment to expanding its continental influence.

"
Algeria will be ready to normalize its relations with Israel ""on the same day when a fully sovereign Palestinian state is establishing."" Thus, the response of the Algerian President, Abdel Majid Taboun, to a question posed by the French newspaper Lubinion on this issue.
Taboun added that his predecessor, President Al -Shazly and President Bouteflika, had previously confirmed that ""they had no problem with Israel. Our only understanding is the establishment of a Palestinian state.""
Although the dialogue conducted by the newspaper with Taboun touched on many issues, such as the Western Sahara and relations with Tunisia, China, France and the United States, and others, most of the attention of the Arab media and Arab media pioneers focused on this statement.
Some of them saw that it was a confirmation of Algeria's steadfast position on the Palestinian issue, while others interpreted it as a transformation in the country's compass and linked it with changing regional and international conditions.
Taboun statement raised many interactions inside Algeria, where some opposition parties and personalities expressed their concern and their rejection of the idea of ??normalization permanently.
End proposed stories
How can this statement be read? Is it really a change in Algerian politics? gesticulate The significance of its timing? Is it already a hidden pressure that the country is exposed to or feels close to it?
Many Algerians have always echoed at the popular and political levels this slogan, which was launched by the late President Houari Boumediene (whose rule continued from 1965 to 1978) as an expression of the country's firm support for the Palestinian issue. The country received Palestinian factions on its soil, led by the Fatah movement, and embraced a number of Palestinian conferences, the most prominent of which was the one who concluded with the announcement of the PLO ""Independence of the State of Palestine"" in 1988. Algeria also helped the Palestinians economically by providing financial grants for them, and hosted the dialogue of the Palestinian factions 2022.
It is known that Algeria did not participate in what is known as the Abrahamic agreements signed by Israel, the UAE and Bahrain in 2020, and the President criticized what he described as ""jogging"" towards normalization, saying that he will not participate or bless it, and stressed that ""the Palestinian issue remains a sacred issue.""

It is worth the end
Some were surprised and expressed concern about the statement of President Taboun, while Others said that it did not bring new because Algeria adopts, like other Arab countries, the peace initiative launched by the late Saudi monarch, King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, in 2002, which aims to establish a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders, the return of refugees, and the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Golan Heights in exchange for normalization Arab countries have relations with Israel.
Many of the pioneers of social media stopped when the President mentioned the word ""Israel"" that he usually referred to and the majority of Algerian politicians and media professionals in the term ""occupied entity"", which was repeated on the Algerian presidency page on Facebook when reviewing the most important thing in the interview conducted by the President With Lobinion.
But Dr. Radwan Bouheidel, a professor of Algerian international relations, says in statements to BBC Arabic that “the word Israel came in the question posed by the journalist, and it is impossible for a French journalist to ask a question in which he says the Zionist entity or the occupied entity. What will be in the future, and not currently, we cannot say to the future the Zionist entity if a Palestinian state is established, we do not recognize an important entity It was, but we may recognize Israel if a Palestinian state is full of rights under the United Nations on the 1967 borders, ""adding that Algeria has a stable position and will not change, and"" it will remain on the side of the Palestinian people until its state is on the 1967 borders and its capital is Al -Quds Al -Sharif. ""
And Bouheidel notes that the President Taboun ""used the word Israel in response to the journalist's statements and did not say the State of Israel, and this is a point that I think should be pointed out,"" adding that the presidency page ""published what Lopinion published to promote the issue before it was completely published.""
The Peace Society Movement, which is the largest Islamic parties in Algeria, issued a statement in which it expressed its ""complete rejection of all settlement and normalization projects"", and reminded the President Taboun that he had previously described it as ""the rejected journey.""
The former movement head of the movement, Abdel -Razzaq Maqri, wrote on his Facebook account: ""When we hear Trump and his advisers talk about expanding the entity and then giving the Palestinians a small state after the displacement of a large part of the Palestinians, the talk of Arab rulers about normalization becomes a frightening and inception of a Palestinian state.""
This was followed by the opposition left -wing Labor Party, in which it said that the party cannot ""imagine any change in The official Algerian position regarding our central cause and therefore the fabricated entity. ”The statement stated that the two -state solution was“ confirmed that it is a trick and a mirage. .
Some commentators saw that Taboun's statement does not mean any change in the Algerian position, because it ""put the knot in the saw"" by talking about a incapacitated condition, as they put it, is the establishment of a full sovereign Palestinian state because Israel and its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will never accept it.
""The President Taboun's statements are neither a retreat nor a change in Algeria's position on the Palestinian issue, but rather the exact opposite ... the President Taboun is well aware that the Israelis who refused to establish a Palestinian state for 75 years of full years will not allow this simply. I think the statement is what It is only an embarrassment for the international community, for those who escape towards normalization without real compensation in favor of the Palestinian issue ... I think it is a word addressed to the international community, not the people The Algerian, because the Algerians know their country's position on this issue. ""
But there are those who expressed his rejection of the idea of ??normalization Absolutely, he warned that this may be ""the beginning"", citing social media platforms with previous statements by the leaders of Arab countries that printed their relations with Israel, in which they expressed their adherence to the establishment of a Palestinian state ""East Jerusalem as its capital.""
Professor Jonathan Hill, director of the Institute of Middle East Studies at the University of Kings College London, told BBC Arabic that he had a change in the position of the Algerian President.
""This shift in the dialect and the talk about preparing to recognize Israel (on the condition of the establishment of a Palestinian state) indicates a change. There were occasions in the past in which the government's position with the people's position was not consistent (for example supporting the coalition led by the United States against Saddam Hussein In the second Gulf War), but not with regard to Israel.

Many of those who refuse to declare Taboun or his conservatives have spoken of pressure from the countries that refuse to normalize with Israel to change their position.
For example, the statement of the Peace Society Movement pointed to pressure exerted by the allied countries with Israel, especially the United States, ""to drag the steadfast countries, including Algeria, to the quagmire of normalization"", and stressed the refusal of the movement For any pressure in this regard.
Some of them linked Taboun's statement and recent regional and international changes, such as the Gaza war, and what is known as the axis of the resistance fell in the wake of the Israeli assassination of Hezbollah leaders and the fall of Bashar al -Assad's regime in Syria.
One of the most prominent of these changes was also a second period for US President Donald Trump, the godfather of the Abrahamic agreements, who had recognized the sovereignty of Morocco on Western Sahara at the end of its first presidential term, following the declaration of Rabat, its approval to normalize relations with Israel. Added to this is the tense relations between Algeria and France, which in return has strengthened its relations with Morocco.
Algeria has recently sought to document its relations with Washington in the military, security and economic fields. For example, the country signed a memorandum of understanding for military cooperation with the US military leadership in Africa ""Africom"" days after President Trump was inaugurated, and on January 22, an agreement was signed with the American Chevron Energy Group to assess the capabilities of marine oil and gas resources in the country. For its part, the United States seeks to enhance its influence in Africa amid growing Chinese investments On the continent.
Professor Hill says, ""The timing of the advertisement is important. It greatly suggests the feeling of the Algerian presidency about the harm that the country may be exposed to if the United States exerts pressure on it or increased its support for Morocco,"" said Professor Hill.
He adds: ""What has changed? The greatest change is a president's arrival in power in the United States that tends much more to conclude deals, and is ready to practice the influence of the United States more publicly (as he did with Colombia and Mexico), not to mention that Algeria is now finding itself in isolation The largest in the West, amid France's efforts to conclude closer ties with Morocco. ""
But Dr. Bouheidel has a different opinion, as he says that ""it is wrong to read the statements of President Abdel Majid Taboun in the context of recent regional changes, especially Trump's arrival in the presidency ... and I also believe that what the president told the French newspaper has nothing to do with our very good relationship with the United States. And Trump has admitted the sovereignty of Morocco, which printed his relationship with Israel through his tweet. Fate, and we are talking about 2025 and we are not in the first term For Trump.
Perhaps the timing of talking about normalization has contributed to the angry reactions, as it comes after a war that lasted for more than a year in Gaza and resulted in the death of more than 46,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, according to the Ministry of Health in the Strip, and Trump's talk about ""cleansing the sector"" and hosting Egypt and Jordan for its residents.
Observers believe that President Taboun’s statement regarding conditional normalization with Israel may be a maneuver in which he tries to hold the stick in the middle, as he seeks to adapt to the regionally and internationally changing geopolitical data, by noting that his country's refusal to establish relations with Israel is not at all, and at the time Himself reassures the internal public opinion that his country will not abandon the condition of establishing a ""full sovereign"" Palestinian state.
But Professor Hill predicts the possibility of the Algerian president's statement that no party.
“Although [the permit] represents a shift in the Algerian position, this shift does not amount to the extent of congruence with Morocco's approach to Israel. It is possible that the actions of Taboun will not satisfy any party - it is more than the Algerians can accept and less than what the United States wants - Then you may leave it in a weaker position.

"Last Sunday, ""Everyone"" was entitled ""Entry to the abyss"", in which the repercussions of the American proposal were described as the displacement of the Palestinians from Gaza to both Egypt and Jordan that it constitutes a harsh earthquake on the region with the consequences of the failure of the proposal, and the measures that Israel will undertake To thwart the current ceasefire, and the consequent results inside Gaza after the return of the war, and outside it, according to what was peace and what was expected of it. Simply put, building the ""peace process"" in the region since the October 1973 War, whether it is an Israeli -Israeli or Palestinian -Israeli, has reached with President Trump's proposals to an abyss of analogy, which needs to come out of a lot of effort, thought and great personalities who can bear the responsibility of making great decisions. Initially, the Middle East constitutes an integrated strategic unit, if a member complains about it, all the members are involved in staying up and fever. Like this, it was said about the Arab world, the Islamic nation, and among strategic scholars, they call this on the European continent, or the ""endopasivic"" or Southeast Asia. All the changes that occur have their comprehensive results on the major issues of war and peace, Building and reconstruction, activating civilization or igniting barbarism.
The current scene started on October 7, 2023, claiming to translate long pain into a new reality; But after a year and five months, it turned into a regional war that extended from the Arabian Gulf to the Red Sea, and from the latter to the Mediterranean, and the rotation of the rockets and the drones. The theaters of the war have become a comprehensive Gaza, the southern Lebanese, and the northern Israeli, in which all of them were destroyed, displaced, promises of victory and the scenes of defeat. The war entered the fingers of states and nails of regions, but the United States was present at all times standing alongside Israel with the hardship of aircraft carriers; Until the last minute of the state of ""Biden"" was seeking a ceasefire, which came after a batch of President Trump. As soon as President Trump entered the White House, his decisions continued at an unprecedented speed, and in an unusual flame in the first days of a new president. And externally, the share of the flame was not going to Ukraine and its war with Russia or to protect Taiwan in its crisis against China, but rather directed to the Middle East and the Gaza Strip in its heart.
The American came with a large storm entitled ""Displacement"" for the people of the Gaza Strip The bereaved, wounding all the owners of the heart and reason, and everyone insults in it by claiming to achieve the interests of the Palestinians in beautiful areas, and to turn their empty sector into a medium beach embraced by the French ""Riviera"". For our generation who lived in the memory of colonial waves, and in reality he had to fight independence and conquest, because what he hears from the American administration constitutes a great insult to human dignity.
Fortunately for me during the previous years and before the Trump raid on Gaza, I raised the slogan ""We have nothing but ourselves"", in all the seminars in which I participated, whether they were in Egypt or in others. The meaning of the slogan regarding the Palestinian issue, and other issues of the region, all of which relate to the failure of the local political forces to reach a word that protects the state from division and civil war. In such cases, external interference usually makes matters worse, and it informs stages of cruelty that requires beds, and makes the conditions nightmares that are difficult to wake up. The first dilemmas we face the surprise that Trump's exit by talking about the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt and Jordan. This was the first blow that came from the heart of strenuous efforts to stop the launch The fire that when it embodies the opening of the door to a wave of optimism attracts the possibilities of the continued ceasefire again, or when successful success, it always encourages fruitful peace talks. The optimism was the indecent wave of pessimism and the human tragedies that resulted from it; But that was more early than the standing should wait for the breezes of peace; But it was an opportunity for the dreamers in the victory of the victory from Hamas, to stand gunmen in military costumes as if the end of the war was dissolved and that their presence in the Strip had become guaranteed. This type of early signs of victory is common in contemporary Arab history, and when it happens it reflects a divine guarantee that fate stands on the side of those standing in the estimated class, but when nature takes its course, the results are completely dire.
The early ""enthusiastic"" victory scattered quickly, and the situation now is not to end the fifth Gaza war, but rather to deal with a harsh displacement process that scattered the Palestinian people away from their homes. Trump seems confident of his project, and he is preparing for him with provocation and extortion of Arab countries, and evoking forgotten areas in the Horn of Africa to form alternatives if Arab refusal continues. Installing the Palestinian people at home It is the beginning that suggests to the world that the Arabs are serious about saving Palestine, or the rest of it. Crazy in the causes of the current critical situation, we find a demographic in the first place, its evidence is located in all documents and statements of the militant and fanatic Israeli right camp, and what seeks to displace the Palestinians is only to achieve a demographic superiority of the Jewish community. Unfortunately, the early knowledge of that required a large population normalization that the displaced Palestinians return to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, or tourism or Arab investments or all of them together, and like that if the population balance did not achieve it, it would prevent the imbalance in it. The dilemma is that normalization has always been a kind of national impurity that is not permissible for pure nations even if the prayer in Palestine is invalidated as a result of forced migration.
In any case, the opportunity was lost at times when Israel was reaping the population change by importing Russian immigrants at the time of their exit from the Soviet ordeal.

* Quoted from ""Al -Masry Al -Youm""",SA
"With cold accounts and far from emotions, Saudi Arabia does not need normalization with the occupying state after the collapse of the Iranian axis in the region, the end of its influence in Syria in particular, and its large reduction in Lebanon. It is no longer in the hands of the American and Zionist lobbies that were pressing Saudi Arabia to push it towards free normalization, any convincing paper to continue the pressure. These lobbies, along with successive American administrations, Netanyahu, and the governments of Israel are the ones that pant the normalization with Saudi Arabia, because all these parties are benefiting from such normalization, and the greatest loser in such a case is Saudi Arabia. But the Saudi policy and the statements issued by Riyadh, especially in the wake of the madness of the statements made by the teenager who governs the White House, all indicate a continuous hardness in the Saudi position that strengthened the entire Arab position, whether on the issue of calling for the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, or on the issue of the Palestinian state.

The radical transformations finally pour in the region in the interest of Saudi Arabia, and in the inventory of a quick account, these transformations can be a group, some of which can maximize the Saudi position in the face of Trump's crazy pressures, especially since he lost globally most of the allies. America, the first of which is Western Europe. A closer look at these transformations, regionally and internationally, and the Saudi diplomatic translation of it stating the following: First, at the level of the region a large vacuum arose after the successive Iranian retreats in Syria and Lebanon, which allowed and provides large spaces for Saudi Arabia to advance regionally and tighten the parties of the Arab region that need leadership Arab regional. Perhaps there is no country that can confront this role except Saudi Arabia, if it sets this as a target of its policy. It is true that Türkiye plays a pivotal role in Syria, but the Syrian future is governed by its Arab scope, and without the Gulf support (and from it the Saudi), Syria will not rise on its feet as it loves and as the whole we love. This means that Syria, which was the heart of the Iranian crescent, which feared Saudi Arabia, becomes gradual in the heart of the Arab district, which is looking for regional leadership. And when Saudi Arabia earns Syria, and with Iran's decline in the east, what is its actual, political and security need for normalization, which will touch its position and leadership of the region?

Second, Saudi Arabia does not need to declare the war on Israel, not even America's discord, but rather everything it puts on the table and sticks to it The Arab Peace Initiative presented and led in 2002, based on international legitimacy and enjoys the support of most (if not all) the countries of the world. It is important, useful and required that a Saudi and collective Arab speech crystallize about that initiative. Although it represents the minimum Palestinian rights, it imposes a strong and collective diplomatic position, and it should not be lost or retracted.

Defending the Palestinian rights and the issue of Palestine is the gateway to regional influence, in the past and the present

Third, the defense of Palestinian rights and the question of Palestine is the gateway to regional influence, in the past and the present. And from the years of the late Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, to Saddam Hussein, all the way to Iran, the near and far historical evidence indicates that Palestine and adhere to its cause and defend it, even if it was verbal and claimed as in many cases, is what gave many Arab regional legitimacy. Neglecting and neglecting Palestine leads to the opposite. The region, its policy, politicians, and everyone currently entered a new stage that exceeded the possibility of using Palestine, a propaganda paper and for verbal things. This use was exposed to a miserable degree. At the time Himself, there is a real possibility for regional leadership and respect for everyone in the Arab world if the Palestinian issue is actually captured and practically at this outstanding moment of Saudi Arabia, and within a clear, strong and strong policy and diplomacy based on the Arab initiative.

Fourth, the temptations that are offered to Saudi Arabia as if they were the advantages and gifts of normalization, whether in terms of military, security and technological, including helping to build peaceful nuclear energy reactors, which can be obtained from many countries, whether from Europe or China. The latter (China) is in a continuous rising approach that in 2049 sets a maximum time time, in which Beijing becomes the capital of the world and the first great power in it against Washington and its allies. Why do they want Saudi Arabia to crush itself and its future with the forces that are gradually declared?


A great opportunity for Saudi Arabia to lead the Arabs and the region, which is an opportunity to suit the current vision of building a leadership Saudi in all fields in the near future

Fifth, the ghost of the teenager Donald Trump, his sins, and his continuous targeting Saudi Arabia remains on the horizon, and to be afraid of her, and not to look at her except as a holder of checks paying at demand. What we collectively we remind him that this teenager will disappear forever after four years, if he completes his presidential term. Trump is not a heavenly destiny that we have to submit to him, listen to his instructions, form the globe and international and regional policy, according to his whims and tots. All governments, and non -governmental organizations, can also buy time and cut it until they go to where there is no return. His teenage policies and statements were created by the annexation of Canada, the Panama channel, Greenland, the control of Gaza, and others an excellent and favorable climate to practice rejecting his dictates and requests in the mouthful, that it comes from an unpleasant and possibly mental source. We have seen the reverse impact of the tramadi madness globally, as he rejected his statements to even the closest allies of America, so we saw the German counselor himself, for example, refuses to displace the Palestinians from Gaza, and confirms that it is part of the Palestinian state with the East Jerusalem and the West Bank. We saw Canadian, European and Latin -American positions that strongly reject Trump's positions, as well as what was issued by China specifically. In the Arab world, we have witnessed the reverse impact of the trambody insanity in the escalation of the tone of Arab rejection and its resurrection, where The Egyptian and Jordanian positions that expressed the rejection of almost unprecedented unprecedented unprecedented unprecedented unprepared, in addition to the Saudi position that provided regional protection for their positions, and to the Arab positions in general.

Sixth and not last, there is a great opportunity for Saudi Arabia to lead the Arabs and the region, and it is an opportunity to suit the current vision of building a leadership Saudi leadership in all fields in the near future. Regional leadership has responsibilities and foods, and at the forefront of these responsibilities Palestine and its cause. Against what Washington and Tel Aviv wants, Riyadh can lead the helm of the region at most of the levels, with Palestine, not at the expense of Palestine. What you want the fanatic right lobbies in Congress and the Knesset completely neutralizing Saudi Arabia in the short term, and thwarting any Saudi aspiration to build a coherent regional entity in the long run. They know completely that Saudi Arabia will lose a lot, especially in terms of its image and political capital in the worlds, Arab and Islamic, if lured to free normalization. And the soft, soft and psychological praise that the intolerance symbols direct with the aim of implicating Saudi Arabia has become exposed and remarkable, especially since the chief priest Netanyahu was unable His hidden desires and his fanaticism were finally attacked, and demanded that it be received by the Palestinian people and the establishment of a Palestinian state in its territory!

According to the writers, analysts, specialists, and university professor, the summit is a test of the ability of Arab countries to translate their positions that reject the displacement into actual and binding policies, which go beyond political data into clear executive mechanisms.

The expectations of writers, analysts, specialists and university professors indicate that the summit will seek to provide a practical alternative to managing the situation in Gaza, which includes a detailed plan for reconstruction and the management of the sector in the ""post -war"" stage.

They confirm that the Riyadh summit is a pre -emptive step to confront the American and Israeli plans that seek to impose new facts on the ground, and to address any attempts to liquidate the Palestinian issue or impose forced solutions that serve Israeli interests.

The Riyadh Summit comes within the framework of completing the diplomatic path Arab

Dr. Dalal Erekat, a professor of diplomacy and conflict dissolution at the Arab American League, said that the expanded Riyadh summit today, Friday, with the participation of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, in addition to Egypt and Jordan, comes within the framework of completing the Arab diplomatic path that started since the outbreak of the Israeli aggression on Gaza.

Erekat notes that this summit comes as part of regional and international efforts aimed at protecting the Palestinian people and preventing forced displacement scenarios.

Erekat pointed out that Arab and international pressure succeeded in stopping the catastrophic scenario of direct forced displacement of the Palestinians, but the gradual displacement is still continuing, which requires sustainable practical steps to confront it.

And she confirms that what we are witnessing today is continuous attempts to impose a new reality on the ground, by expanding Israeli settlement, destroying the infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and creating an unpopular environment, which forcibly pushes the Palestinians towards migration, which is another form of forced displacement Unnamed.

Erekat believes that the outputs of the Riyadh summit will be a real test of the ability of Arab countries to translate their positions that refuse to displace To actual and binding policies, political data goes beyond clear executive mechanisms that prevent the reproduction of displacement scenarios in any way.

Erekat explains that the Arab countries are required to provide a practical alternative to the Trump administration, which includes a detailed and preferred plan for its visualization of the ""next day"" stage in Gaza, in order to persuade the American administration of an alternative plan that prevents displacement and annexation and the achievement of the ""Greater Israel"" project, which eliminates the right of the Palestinian people to determine their fate .

Erekat stressed that despite the clarity of Arab positions in refusing to displace and emphasize the right of the Palestinian people to self -determination, the absence of the Palestinians from the meeting raises questions about the possibility of scenarios prepared for the stage of ""the next day"" outside the framework of the Palestinian Authority and the ""Hamas"" movement.

Erekat notes that these scenarios may include new security arrangements, such as the presence of joint Arab or European security forces for the Gaza administration, which requires clear and coordination with the Palestinian leadership to ensure that they are not overcome in any future arrangements.

Erekat stresses the need for the Riyadh summit to provide a detailed, written and practical alternative, which is applicable and is the basis for a political solution. Comprehensive, as this alternative must be more realistic and acceptable than any previous displacement plans, such as the Trump plan, which was previously presented to the Gaza Affairs Department.

Erekat calls for reading the recent statements of US President Donald Trump in the context of ""forced diplomacy"", as it uses it as a pressure tool to reduce the ceiling of Arab and Palestinian expectations about the coming solutions.

Erekat explains that the displacement waving comes as a tactic to notify the Palestinians and the Arabs of the danger of the situation and pushed them towards making political concessions, in conjunction with the upcoming normalization arrangements, which may be Saudi Arabia at its forefront.

It indicates that Saudi Arabia is standing in a complex strategic position in light of the presence of the Trump administration, as it leads at the same time the international alliance to implement the two -state solution.

Erekat stresses the necessity of using this role to push the international community towards a just and comprehensive solution that protects Palestinian rights, and prevents any attempts to overcome them under any name.

A great political importance for the summit of Riyadh and Cairo

A professor of political science at Birzeit University, d. Saad Nimr, that the Arab mini summit in Riyadh is gaining great political importance, but it is not the most prominent event, as the emergency Arab summit in Cairo is the most Allergy, as it will put the Egyptian plan to deal with the situation in Gaza on the search table in front of the Arab countries concerned.

Nimr believes that the emergency summit in Cairo will be decisive in crystallizing the joint Arab position on Gaza, where the Egyptian plan will be officially presented.

Nimr explains that this plan is based on the principle of refusal of forced displacement of the Palestinians, which is an agreed position among all Arab countries, but it raises fundamental questions about the following steps, especially with regard to the management of the sector after the war.

Nimer confirms that the leaks on the Egyptian plan indicate the possibility of Arab forces to supervise the security situation in Gaza, as well as the disarmament of the ""Hamas"" movement, which may enjoy American approval in exchange for the commitment to the refusal of the displacement.

He notes that these issues are raised as part of a political barter, as the United States and Israel seek to impose a new reality in Gaza without allowing the situation to return to what they were before the war.

Nimer confirms that the Arab countries are aware of the danger of the American-Israeli plan on the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, especially Egypt and Jordan, which will be the most affected by any mass migration waves.

It indicates that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already hinted at the possibility of moving the population of Gaza to Saudi Arabia, which explains the Arab consensus that rejects displacement as an existential threat to the region.

Nimer explains that the summit will try to find an alternative solution to the displacement plan, but the main question remains: What is this alternative?

Will Arab countries accept the imposition of a joint Arab-Palestinian administration on Gaza? Will you be able to persuade the United States and Israel that this option guarantees security and stability without the need to displace the population?

It indicates that the Arab position must be firmly refusing to displacement without any conditions or compensation, and not just searching for alternatives that are in line with the American vision.

According to Nimr, the Arab summit will be largely dependent on the results of the meeting in Riyadh. If an Arab consensus is reached on the Egyptian plan, it is likely to be officially adopted, even if some countries such as Algeria or other countries intercede on some of its details.

Nimer stresses that the consensus on the refusal of forced displacement does not necessarily mean reaching a just and fair solution for the Palestinians, but it may be just a tactical step to pass other solutions that satisfy the United States and Israel.
Nimer confirms that the central issue is not Only in rejecting the displacement, but in determining the post -rejection, that is, how Gaza will be managed politically and security, and who will bear the responsibility for reconstruction, and what are the guarantees for not imposing forced solutions on the Palestinians that serve Israeli interests.

He believes that the meeting in Riyadh is the key to what will happen later at the Arab summit, where the extent of Arab countries will be tested to impose their own vision, without undergoing American and Israeli pressure.

Nimer confirms that adhering to the Arab position rejecting displacement is a positive step, but it is not sufficient if it is not associated with a clear strategic vision that guarantees the Palestinians their rights to self -determination without external interventions.

Arab attempt to remedy the current political situation

The writer and political analyst Suleiman Bisharat confirms that the Arab summit that is held in Riyadh is considered extremely important, not only for its sensitive timing, but the nature of the topic for which it was required, which is to discuss ""Trump's vision"" of the Palestinian issue and address the issues of the Middle East.

Bisharat indicates that the summit comes within the framework of an Arab attempt to remedy the current political situation, and cut off the way for what the United States and Israel might seek at the stage. Next.

Bisharat explains that the speed of the summit contract reflects the desire of Arab leaders to not leave a political or temporal vacuum that Washington and Tel Aviv can be used to impose visions or solutions that do not take into account the Arab position or the needs of peoples in the region.

""The summit does not want to give a time space that may allow the imposition of a unilateral American American vision, which makes this step proactive and important,"" Bisharat says.

Bisharat believes that the expanded Arab summit in Cairo, which will follow the Riyadh meeting, is largely a protocol, while the Riyadh summit comes as a practical step aimed at developing a unified Arab vision that can be adopted and activated if the appropriate conditions are available.

A proactive step to draw the features of the alternative Arab vision

Bisharat notes that the Riyadh Summit includes the actors and directly concerned with the political repercussions of the Palestinian issue, which makes it a proactive step to draw the features of the alternative Arab vision.

Bisharat confirms that the decisions that will be out of the Riyadh summit will form the basic ground and the agenda of the discussions that will take place at the expanded Arab summit, if held.

Bisharat says: ""The Riyadh Summit will determine the general features of the vision Arab, which will constitute the road map for the next stage, which makes it a very important strategic step. ""

Bisharat notes that the summit, although it is not announced directly or clearly, will put the basic points of any future Arab position or decision on the Palestinian issue.

""The summit will present an alternative Arab vision for the American -Israeli plan, which is an attempt to block the American position that ignores Arab and Palestinian rights,"" Bisharat says.

Although Bisharat acknowledges that this Arab vision cannot be associated with or fully defining its features at this stage, it confirms that the summit is a serious attempt to confront the American -Israeli offering.

""In the end, this summit is an attempt to fill the political void that Washington and Tel Aviv may use, and it is a step towards forming a unified Arab position that reflects the interests of the Arab peoples and preserves Palestinian rights,"" Bisharat says.

Bisharat believes that the summit, although it is a first step, will lay the foundations for a comprehensive Arab vision that can be built on the coming stages, especially in light of the great challenges facing the Palestinian issue and the region as a whole.

The need to establish a unified Arab position to confront Challenges

The writer and political researcher, d. Loyalties of old women, that the expanded Riyadh summit comes in the context of the necessity of establishing a unified Arab position to face the current challenges, especially the dangers of displacement of the Palestinians, explaining that the Riyadh summit is important for the agreement of the participating countries and remove the differences on how to finance the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip and also how to manage the sector.

Old women stress that the summit represents an opportunity to formulate a joint Arab response that rejects any plans aimed at changing the demographic reality in Palestine, which calls for decisive decisions that prevent the implementation of these projects that threaten Arab national security.

Old women explain that regional and international developments require a real awareness of the Arab countries for the repercussions of the American position biased in favor of Israel, as this policy directly affects the national security of Egypt and Jordan, as well as its repercussions on the Arab region as a whole, considering that the Palestinian issue is not only the issue of the Palestinians, but an Arab issue And Islamic.

Old women indicate that the upcoming summit in Cairo bears special, as it is expected to form a major station in the crystallization of a comprehensive Arab vision for the reconstruction of Gaza.

And old women stress that this issue Determining roles and responsibilities, and agreeing on clear mechanisms to ensure the reconstruction of the sector in a framework that enhances stability, is not just a temporary procedure without a clear political vision, and from here lies the importance of the Riyadh summit expanding to crystallize a position that establishes the Cairo summit.

Old women believe that the Riyadh Summit represents a real test of the extent of Arab countries committing to present practical solutions that guarantee the refusal of displacement and the protection of the Palestinian issue from liquidation attempts.

Old women assert that the Arab and regional reality in light of the new American policies requires Arab leaders to realize the necessity of forming a coherent unified position, because the liquidation of the Palestinian issue will not be limited to the Palestinians alone, but will affect the entire Arab national security.

Old women touched that the position of the United States cannot be relied upon, noting that the American bias for the benefit of Israel provokes Arab and Islamic feelings, which may lead to an unexpected escalation in the event of the implementation of the displacement plans or the liquidation of the Palestinian issue.

Old women assert that the bet on the silence of the Arab peoples is not a guaranteed choice, especially since any attempts to force the Palestinians to leave their lands will face it with reactions on The official and popular levels, which increases the complexity of the situation in the region.

Old women stressed that the reconstruction of Gaza should be part of a comprehensive solution, and not just an emergency response to the humanitarian situation.

Old women believe that Arab leaders are required to develop clear and specific plans to secure international support for reconstruction, while ensuring that the Palestinian issue is not used as a political bargaining card.

Old women indicate that Washington may be ready to retract its position regarding the displacement if it finds that the alternatives proposed serve their interests, which requires Arab leaders to submit applicable proposals without exceeding Palestinian rights.

And it stresses that any solution that ignores the legitimate Palestinian rights will lead to an increase in the complexity of the situation in the region, which may expose American and Israeli interests to unexpected dangers.

Old women assert that the refusal of the displacement must be a firm Arab Arab position, and not just a negotiating position, noting that the continuation of talking about ""acceptable alternatives"" instead of rejecting the displacement categorically may lead to erosion of the Arab position, which opens the door for projects that threaten the Palestinian presence.

Old women believe that the next Arab summit should send a message It is clear to the United States and the international community that the displacement is not an option, and that any attempts to impose it will face it with a decisive Arab rejection.

Old women assert that the next stage requires joint Arab efforts to provide a clear political vision, which prevents the implementation of any plans aimed at liquidating the Palestinian issue or threatening regional stability.

Providing an Arab vision that supports the establishment of the Palestinian state and the two -state solution

The Egyptian writer and political analyst d. Amr Hussein that the attention is heading to the upcoming Riyadh summit, which will be held today, Friday, with the participation of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Egypt and Jordan, with the aim of discussing the current challenges, led by the displacement plan in the Gaza Strip.

Hussein notes that Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi left Spain heading to Saudi Arabia to attend the Riyadh summit, which is a major station to formulate a unified Arab position to confront the displacement plan.

According to Hussein, the Arab Republic of Egypt is leading efforts to crystallize a unified Arab plan, aiming to thwart the Israeli displacement project in Gaza, and to provide a strategic alternative that prevents the liquidation of the Palestinian issue.

Hussein explains that the American administration led by President Donald Trump justifies its support For the plans of displacement with two basic arguments: the continued rule of Hamas in the Strip, and the inability of Gaza to life due to the widespread destruction, and in this context, the Arab countries are working to formulate an integrated plan that will be presented to the White House, which expressed its willingness to consider the Arab proposal, in light of the coincidences of the coincidence of a crowd European support for the Arab position.

Hussein believes that the Riyadh summit is pre -emptive for the upcoming Cairo summit next month, during which it will be established clear foundations to confront the plans aimed at liquidating the Palestinian issue, and working to provide an Arab vision that supports the establishment of the Palestinian state and the two -state solution.

Hussein stresses the importance of Arab moves at a time when Gaza is witnessing a serious challenge, which increases the importance of uniting the Arab position to thwart attempts to impose new facts on the ground, according to an Israeli vision backed by the United States.

Any funding for reconstruction is not possible with the presence of ""Hamas"" in the ruling

The writer and political analyst David, a writer, believes that the Riyadh Summit aims mainly to ensure the financial resources necessary for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, stressing that the speed and efficiency of reconstruction with Arab support will be the strongest response to the displacement plans adopted by the President's administration American Donald Trump.

Writers explain that the Arab countries are aware of the importance of providing significant financial support for the reconstruction of the devastating Gaza Strip due to the Israeli aggression, but this funding depends on a fundamental change in the Gaza administration.

Writers indicate that there is a trend inside the summit to ask Egypt and Qatar to put pressure on the ""Hamas"" movement to push it to step down from the Gaza Strip administration, or accept the establishment of a new Palestinian authority or a joint Palestinian-Arab administration that takes over the affairs of Gaza.

A writer confirms that there is an international and Arab consensus that any financing for the reconstruction of Gaza will not be possible in light of the continued rule of ""Hamas"", indicating that the international community is calling for a new administrative framework that ensures that wars are not repeated and prevents the exploitation of aid for political or military purposes.

Writers note that Israel has a conviction that it will not stop its continuous aggression on Gaza as long as there is no change in the management of the Strip, considering that the formation of a new authority that has Arab and international acceptance will be the only way to secure the necessary funding and stop the Israeli -Palestinian war against the Palestinians in Gaza.",PS

These statements came during a dialogue session at the World Government Summit held recently in Dubai.
In response to a question about the possibility of finding a common ground with the American administration on the Middle East, the Emirati ambassador said: ""We will try, I think the current approach will be difficult, but in the end, we are all on the task of searching for solutions, but we do not know where things will end.""

"This article transforms a different direction to what Donald Trump is writing and the descriptions that he calls, as he is a developed real estate developer that derives his ideas from imagination and deliberately with his exciting statements transforming attention from his main battle inside the United States and distracting public opinion according to what is known as the Paton plan by raising noisy discussions to distract attention from his plans. The real through a talk about the inclusion of Canada And the acquisition of the Panama channel and the purchase of Greenland, the occupation of the devastating Gaza and the displacement of its people by claiming that it was transferred to ""Rvira, the Middle East"". What Trump pronounces or declares is not imagination, illusion or attempt to turn attention from other issues, he may not be able to achieve all his threats, but he will use them to tools of these countries, trying to force them to make concessions that make gains. It should also be seen (and his policies) as the President of the United States, the first power in the world, and not as a mockery and surprise.
Trump's policies in our region are not a result of the moment, some of which were put in the Trump -Netanyahu deal during his first term. Therefore, his plans related to Gaza and the West Bank must be dealt with And normalization is serious, and it is not permissible to see it with lightness or mockery, or ignore it as issued by an obsessed person, it is a clear planned plan issued by the first force, and it is the product of a long planning that started from the first day of the genocide war, and democratic and republican administrations in the United States, in cooperation With Zionist research centers, it is consistent with the Zionist thought, rooted The idea of ??ethnic displacement in the essence of its ideology and policies, and it has already practiced it in the ""Nakba"" in 1948, in the ""setback"" in 1967, and in internal displacement against our people in Palestine occupied since 1948, and the Zionist thought has previously proposed patterns of it in its first deal. Therefore, you should prepare to confront him and confront him, and not bend in front of his storm.

Trump wants to emigrate the people of Gaza towards Sinai and Egypt, and the people of the West Bank towards Jordan, taking advantage of the Gaza Strip has become a non -human life area, It lacks the necessary services, and needs years, estimated between five to ten years to remove the rubble, lack real job opportunities, educational and health facilities, and to sustainable food needs after the genocide war destroyed all the elements of life in it. Trump's scenarios for the displacement of the people of Gaza (but sometimes contradicted) between his saying that it is a temporary migration and his talk about preventing the people of Gaza from returning to it after their displacement, and is not satisfied with their displacement to Egypt, but rather puts stakes for other countries to receive them, extending from Indonesia to Albania and Canada. The constant is the plan for the displacement, which has become a common denominator for all these scenarios, which was sought by the Zionist circles since the first week of the war, and it was reported that the Biden administration has set a plan to establish a free area in the Sinai, whose area is estimated at five times the area of ??the Gaza Strip, and it is recorded to Palestinian entities or or A joint Palestinian Palestinian, to absorb the people of Gaza Strip, And providing them with job opportunities, and that the Trump administration has agreed to this plan, which will appear as a humanitarian response to the suffering of people in Gaza, or as a temporary solution until the rubble is raised, and the brown is returned Infrastructure, but in practice it will produce new facts, and will lead to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of sector population.
In the West Bank, Trump promised that he would determine the part that he would include to the Zionist entity within three months, and he had moved the United States embassy to Jerusalem, which he agreed to annex, and to include 30% of the West Bank area in his first deal, in which he divided the remaining remaining Palestinian land between separate cantons, and plans to displace the Palestinians into several countries. Trump did not succeed in passing this in front of a unified Palestinian position and a supportive Arab position, and this project was buried with the end of his first term, to renovate it wider and more comprehensive, which may reach the inclusion of the ""C"" region, which is estimated at 61% of the West Bank. It separates the Palestinians and their land, and works to uproot them from their homes on the pretext of providing better life conditions for them, considering that Israel is a small country that needs to expand and grow at their expense.
The main entrance to thwarting the Trump scheme starts from breaking the siege on Gaza

The failure of the second Trump deal is possible and available, and it requires the provision of resilience ingredients for the Palestinian people in its land, and it is a task that shares it.

This will promote the continuation of criminal prosecutions, international trials and popular movements to isolate Israel and expose its practices at the global level.
The failure of the plans is possible, necessary and necessary, not for the sake of Palestine alone, but to protect the entire Arab world from the Zionist normalization and domination plans, and it needs a unified official Arab position, the Palestinian national unity, and a Palestinian awareness that this plan targets the Palestinian in Gaza, the West Bank and the Palestinian Interior, as It targets all Palestinian currents and forces, and does not differentiate between them, as it is the hour of unity and awareness And confrontation in the battle of existence.",UK

The attention is directed to the upcoming five -year summit in Riyadh, which comes at a sensitive political moment in the Israeli and American ambitions and the fateful challenges facing the Palestinian issue.

A book, political analysts, specialists, and university professors believe in separate conversations with ""?"", that this summit emerges as a decisive opportunity for Arabs to overcome narrow accounts and unify their ranks In the face of the risks that threaten Palestinian rights, with anticipation of decisions that go beyond formal condemnation towards practical procedures that reflect a real political will, and to pave the five -year summit of decisive decisions at the next Arab summit in Cairo on the twenty -seventh of this month.

A pivotal political station amid regional developments

Professor d. Jamal Harfoush, Professor of Curricula for Scientific Research and Political Studies at the University of the Academic Center for Research in Brazil, that holding the five -year summit in Riyadh with the participation of Palestine represents a pivotal political station amid regional developments and fateful challenges facing the Palestinian issue.

Harfosh stresses that this summit may constitute a qualitative shift in the Arab position if it exceeds the traditional condemnation stage and moved to taking effective and binding measures that reflect the true Arab political will.

It indicates that the current stage, in light of the Israeli escalation and international pressure, requires fateful decisions of Arab leaders that go beyond formal data, considering that the continued Arab mutation or the issuance of non -binding decisions will only lead to weakening the Palestinian position and opening the way for more Israeli tulture on the Palestinian soil .

Harfoush asserts that the success of this summit will be dependent on the extent of the participating countries' ability to overcome narrow political accounts and inter -differences, and to unify the Arab ranks in a practical position that amounts to the level of challenges, Especially in light of the Israeli military escalation, which aims to impose solutions that do not serve the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.

The five -year summit is expected to focus on a number of fateful files that reflect the depth of the challenges facing the Palestinian issue.

Harfoush explains that one of the most prominent issues is: refusal of forced displacement and imposing a new reality in Gaza, while calling on the international community to move urgently to prevent the occupation from implementing the policies of genocide and mass displacement against the Palestinians, and to stop the Israeli aggression and lift the siege on the Gaza Strip, while emphasizing the necessity of reconstruction with a guarantee Arab guarantee the return of the natural life of the sector.

Harfoush notes that the summit will emphasize the confrontation of settlement and Judaization in the West Bank and Jerusalem, through mechanisms of direct material support to enhance the steadfastness of the Palestinians and reject any attempts to the temporal and spatial division of the Al -Aqsa Mosque, as well as taking Arab measures to protect Islamic and Christian sanctities from Judaization and violations.

Among the outputs, according to Harfoush, is unified Arab movements in international forums to support the Palestinian leadership in its endeavors to obtain full membership in the United Nations, with the escalation of the legal battle against Occupation before the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice, in order to enhance international pressure on Israel and expose its continuous violations.

Likewise, according to Harfoush, reviewing Arab relations with Israel, by reviewing the normalization agreements that did not lead to any Israeli commitment to resolving the Palestinian issue, but rather was used to perpetuate the occupation and expand settlement, which requires imposing deterrent economic and diplomatic measures, including the freezing of security cooperation or Economic.

On the relationship between the upcoming five -year summit in Riyadh and the expanded Arab Cairo summit, Harfoush explains that the five -year summit will be a real test of the unified Arab position, as its results will determine the course of the Cairo summit and its ability to come up with solid decisions.

Harfoush shows that the effect of the five -year summit on the Cairo summit will be tangible through three main axes: crystallizing consensus on clear and binding decisions in preparation for the exit of the Cairo summit with more solid decisions, but if it fails to achieve harmony in positions, this will weaken the Cairo summit and make it unable to take Decisive decisions.

The second thing, according to Harfoush, raised the ceiling of decisions at the Cairo summit, so if it contains The five -year summit is bold positions, such as imposing economic sanctions or international legal steps against the occupation, this will put pressure on the summit of Cairo to adopt similar positions, which will increase the weight of the Arab position in international forums, but if the results of the five -year summit come, this may lead to frustration of the street Arab and Palestinian.

Harfoush notes that the third matter is to give a momentum to international diplomatic moves by establishing a unified Arab diplomatic campaign to support the Palestinian position in international forums, which may give the Cairo Summit an additional power to adopt decisions that support the Palestinian issue strongly and clearly.

Harfoush confirms that the success of the five -year summit in Riyadh will constitute a decisive introduction to the success of the Cairo summit, as the unity of the Arab decision will strengthen the Palestinian position at the international level, but any decline or negligence in positions will only lead to the continuation of the Israeli aggression without deterrence.

Harfosh stresses that the next stage requires political courage and solid Arab will, because the Palestinian issue no longer tolerates more formal data or undisputed diplomatic statements.


The coming days will witness important political benefits

The writer emphasizes And the political analyst Khalil Shaheen that the coming days will witness important political benefits related to the Gaza Strip file, starting with the five -year summit in Riyadh, which will be held in the presence of a Palestinian, then the emergency Arab summit in Cairo, followed by the meeting of the foreign ministers of Islamic countries.

Shaheen notes that these political stations fall within the framework of discussing the mechanisms of confronting US President Donald Trump's plan to displace the people of the Gaza Strip.

Shaheen explains that the holding of the five -year summit reflects an Egyptian and Jordanian direction to form an Arab consensus that paves the way for the success of the emergency Arab summit in Cairo, stressing the existence of an Arab and Palestinian consensus clearly on rejecting the principle of displacement, despite the continued differences over other files, most notably the reconstruction of Gaza and the conditions for its financing.

Shaheen deals with the details of the Egyptian plan for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, explaining that it is taking place in coordination with the Palestinian side and with the participation of European parties.

Shaheen notes that the plan includes stages that begin with the introduction of the rubble removal equipment and secure safe areas for the displaced, then move to the settlement of lands and gradually rebuilding according to specific areas.

It is believed that the dispute over the plan is mainly centered on the side Financing, where some Arab countries, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, require that Hamas be abandoned by the sector's management as a condition to participate in the financing of reconstruction.

Shaheen notes that other Arab parties link their support with reforms within the Palestinian Authority, including the reconstruction or amendment of the government.

Shaheen refers to a former Egyptian proposal to form the ""Community Support Committee"", as a transitional mechanism for the Gaza administration outside the framework of Hamas, but it was met with the rejection of President Mahmoud Abbas and the Fatah movement.

Shaheen explains that the Arab position is divided into two main directions: the first supports the strengthening of the role of the Palestinian Authority, provided that reforms are implemented, whether by forming a new government headed by another figure or by conducting a limited cabinet reshuffle with the survival of Dr. Muhammad Mustafa as prime minister, while the second trend, which Egypt represents, calls To form an administrative committee that follows the Palestinian Authority during a transitional phase, as a consensual solution that will gradually exit Hamas from the scene.

Shaheen confirms that the five -year summit represents a decisive station in the Palestinian reconciliation file, as it may witness an Arab consensus on a mechanism to manage the Gaza Strip, which will put pressure on the two sides of the Palestinian division, the Fatah and Hamas movements, to reach an agreement on Reshaving the government or forming a transitional committee to manage the sector.

Shaheen stresses that the absence of internal Palestinian consensus may push Arab countries to impose a ready formula as a condition for obtaining Arab support for reconstruction.

And it confirms that the emergency Arab summit, which will track down the five -year summit, as well as the Islamic Summit, is expected to support the Egyptian proposal for reconstruction, which is presented as an alternative to the American displacement plan.

Shaheen notes that this plan, if it has Arab support, will create a new political dynamic and constitute an alternative to the American proposal in the international corridors.

On the financing of reconstruction, Shaheen confirms that the success of the Egyptian plan requires wide Arab support, especially from influential countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the Emirates, in addition to mobilizing international support from the European Union, Russia and China, which usually supports the collective Arab position, stressing that the Arab consensus on the plan It will contribute to facilitating the crowd of international financing.

Shaheen stresses that the most complex challenge is to define the Palestinian side that will supervise the reconstruction process.

Shaheen believes that this file may be decided either through an internal Palestinian consensus Or through Arab pressure that imposes a transitional formula, warning of the scenario of ""political void"", which may lead to the disruption of the implementation of the reconstruction plan despite the availability of Arab and international support.

Shaheen stresses the need for the Palestinians to initiate a serious internal dialogue between Fatah and Hamas, with the aim of providing a consensual formula for the Arab side, to avoid the scenario of imposing ready solutions from abroad that does not serve Palestinian interests in the long run.

Introduction to the upcoming Arab summit in Cairo

A professor of political science at Birzeit University, d. Saad Nimr, that the five -year summit to be held in Riyadh comes within the framework of preparing for the upcoming Arab summit, with the aim of agreeing on a joint perception presented to Arab leaders.

Nimr notes that there are leaks that talk about an Egyptian plan that may be shown during the five -year summit before the Arab summit in Cairo at the end of this month.

Nimr explains that these leaks indicate a proposal that gives Egypt responsible for military supervision of the Gaza Strip, while another Arab party takes over the civil administration and that Egypt undertakes the reconstruction, without the involvement of the Palestinian Authority, which corresponds to the Israeli and American proposals aimed at excluding each of the authority. Palestinian and Hamas from the political scene.

Nimr expresses his concern that this proposal will lead to the formation of an Arab administration for the Gaza Strip, under Egyptian sponsorship, similar to the situation that was standing before 1967.

Nimr notes that these data raises serious questions about the extent of Egypt's ability to deal with security and military challenges in the Gaza Strip.

Nimer confirms that these proposals do not represent a political victory for the Palestinians and do not make a fair solution to the Palestinian cause, as they ignore the right of the Palestinian people to self -determination and investigate the basic Palestinian parties of any future arrangements.

Nimr links this offering with previous statements to US President Donald Trump about the possibility of the displacement of Gaza residents, a proposal that sparked widespread confusion in Arab positions.

Nimr stresses that the forced displacement of the Gaza population is practically impossible, given the categorical Palestinian rejection, in addition to the official rejection from Egypt and Jordan to receive any displaced from the Strip.

Nimer believes that the next Arab summit will adopt positions rejecting annexation and displacement, but it may remain in the context of statements without moving to concrete practical steps, as is the practice in Previous Arab summits.

Nimr affirms that if the Arabs want them to be different this time, they must face challenges with decisive positions and procedures instead of being satisfied with verbal statements.

A detailed moment in the history of the Arab position

The writer and political analyst Adnan Al -Sabah confirms that the five -year summit in Riyadh represents a detailed moment in the history of the Arab position towards the Palestinian issue, stressing that the required Arab is easier than the leaders, but it requires real political will and fateful decisions.

Al -Sabah indicates that the essence of the issue is that the Israeli occupation, supported by the United States of America, seeks to download the Arabs the consequences of their crime against the Palestinian issue.

Al -Sabah explains that the United States and the occupation state do not want to displace the Palestinians to Jordan or Egypt, because this will represent a direct threat to their national security, or to open new fronts that may threaten the stability of the entire region.
Al -Sabah believes that the real responsibility to respond to Trump's plans in the displacement is a Palestinian collective responsibility, not the responsibility of the Arabs.

Al -Sabah confirms that this approach represents a strategic danger, because the real goal is to push Palestinians to accept options that do not meet the minimum national rights, or pushing them to forced migration, while Trump seeks to hold the Arabs responsible for his crisis.

Al -Sabah says: ""If the Palestinian people are required to be expelled, let him ask those who want to take responsibility, not to dismiss it and give it to the Arabs alone.""

On the American role in this scenario, Al -Sabah indicates that the administration of US President Donald Trump aims to use the Gaza Strip as a key to expanding its influence in the region.

Al -Sabah notes that the United States is seeking to find an entry to enter the Gaza Strip under the pretext of achieving stability or reconstruction, while the real goal is to turn Gaza into an American military base from which the conflicts of the region are running, including pressure on Egypt and controlling gas fields in the eastern Mediterranean, including It has Egyptian gas.

It is believed that the American plan does not stop at Palestine, but rather extends to imposing domination on the entire region, but rather confronting European interests in the region.

Al -Sabah refers to the dangerous statement that Trump made in the presidential section speech when he said: ""The war that triumphs is is the war that you do not fight.""

And clarify Morning that this phrase reflects the American domination doctrine based on political and economic pressure instead of direct wars, stressing that Washington seeks to ignite the agency wars to achieve its goals without direct engagement in long -term conflicts.

Al -Sabah warns that the Arabs' response to American pressure will only bring more chaos and wars in the region, indicating that the American goal is to dominate the region's wealth and turn it into a permanent conflict arena that serves American interests alone, as America seeks to turn itself into an empire that controls the world. It is only through the stroke of wars and blood.

Al -Sabah stresses that what is required of the Arab leaders at the Riyadh summit is not a miracle, but rather a clear position that restores the Palestinian issue to its position as a central world issue, especially after the murderer in the Gaza Strip.

Al -Sabah says: ""If the Arabs want, the decision is easier than they imagine, because the presence of the Palestinians on their land is not an Arab problem, as it has achieved them, and the problem is those who force them to migrate.""

A historical opportunity to redraw the Arab position towards the Palestinian issue

The writer and political analyst d. Abdul Majeed Sweilem that The upcoming five -year summit in Riyadh represents a detailed station in the Arab dealing with the challenges facing the Palestinian issue, warning that the continuation of the state of Arab indolence is no longer acceptable in light of the exacerbation of the danger that threatens the entire region.

Swailem stresses that the current stage no longer tolerates the policy of ""agreeing not to agree"", which characterized Arab positions in the past.

The seriousness of the situation is not only in the practical ability to implement the Trump TV around Gaza, according to Sweilem, who believes that the applied capabilities of such a plan are weak, but it clearly reflects that the danger has become imminent, as Israel or the United States will not hesitate to exploit any favorable opportunity to implement Their plans.

Swailem stresses that this imminent danger imposes on Arab countries to change the way they deal with the Palestinian issue, because the threat is on the threshold of the Arab world, and it is no longer possible to continue the policies of dribbling or suffice with symbolic positions.

Swailem believes that the Arabs missed an important opportunity after October 2023, when the war broke out on Gaza, as they could have contained the rising danger if they took a firm position to support the Palestinian people In confronting the Israeli aggression, which is absolutely supported by the United States, stressing that what was required at the time was not to enter into a direct war, but rather adopting a strong and active political position facing aggression and highlighting the world the unity of the Arab position.

Swailem stresses that the failure of the Arab countries from the actual move at the time was a great political loss, as they lost the opportunity to build a political balance in front of their peoples, and weakened their regional and international position, at a time when the battle went beyond the Gaza borders to a comprehensive threat to Arab national security.

With regard to the upcoming five -year summit in Riyadh, Swailem indicates that he does not expect formal or limited decisions to be issued on the usual denunciation and condemnation, but rather is likely to result in more advanced steps, albeit less than the level of the challenges imposed.

Sweilem asserts that the current Arab regimes lack the ability to confront American hegemony or challenge Israeli arrogance in a manner that is commensurate with the size of the risk, but they are forced to make qualitative decisions that restore some lost confidence to their people.

Swailem explains that the five -year summit decisions are expected to include a full rejection of the displacement plans, and to emphasize the unity of the Palestinian territories, including This is because the Gaza Strip is an integral part of the Palestinian state, in addition to the emphasis that any future peace process must be conditional on prior recognition of the establishment of the Palestinian state on the borders of the fourth of June 1967.

Swailem notes that the five -year summit may also stress that the continuation of Arab relations with Israel or the United States depends on their commitment to a real political path that leads to a two -state solution, pointing out that the existing agreements between some Arab countries and Israel will not stand up if the occupation continues to ignore Palestinian rights.

Swailem asserts that the five-year summit can represent an important introduction to the upcoming Arab summit, as part of a basic goal that is to pave the way towards building a wide Arab-Islamic front to confront American and Israeli plans.

Swailem stresses that this front should include the countries of the global south and the European Union, considering that the unification of efforts at the regional and international levels can constitute an impenetrable dam in front of the American-Israeli arrogance.

Swailem believes that the success of the five -year summit in achieving this goal requires that its outputs exceed stereotypes, and to carry a clear message that the defense of it Palestine is essentially a defense of Arab national security, noting that this fact has become more clear after the escalation of the Israeli aggression and the expansion of its threats.

Sweilem asserts that the five -year summit represents a historical opportunity to redraw the Arab position towards the Palestinian issue, calling for a conversion to a founding platform for a wider global front that includes Arab and Islamic countries alongside the forces of the south and European Union countries.

Swailem stresses that the success of these efforts will be a great victory not only for Palestine, but for the truth and justice, as the political realism that the summit must adopt is not the one that suits the fait accompli, but that faces challenges with wisdom and effectiveness, and defend the higher interests of Palestine and the Arab national security.

The results of the ""five -year"" will be reflected on the outcomes of the Arab summit

The writer and political analyst specializing in international relations, Noman Abed, confirms that the American and Israeli vision has become clear on the Palestinian issue, as the Israeli occupation state with the support of the United States of America seeks to liquidate the Palestinian issue, whether through settlement policies in the West Bank or through the displacement plans for residents Gaza Strip.

Abed notes that these plans aim to end the conflict for the benefit of Israel, and to hold the countries of the region's responsibility, ignoring their national and historical political rights.

Abed explains that the plan of US President Donald Trump, which included the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, was accompanied by Israeli escalation measures, most notably the re -occupation of areas in the Strip, the escalation of settlement and the Judaization of East Jerusalem in the West Bank.

Abed asserts that these steps reveal an integrated American-Israeli plan that aims to liquidate the Palestinian issue and delete it from the international agenda, in exchange for the Arab and regional countries to hold the burden of their repercussions, especially with regard to the responsibility of Palestinian refugees.

Abed notes that the Egyptian and Jordanian response to the displacement plan was decisive, as the two countries announced their categorical rejection of any proposals related to the displacement of the Palestinian people, stressing that this clear position was a checkpoint in front of passing projects aimed at liquidating Palestinian national rights.

Abed refers to the features of a new Egyptian plan aimed at stabilizing the Palestinian people on their land, especially in the Gaza Strip, through the gradual reconstruction With the participation of Palestinian hands and experiences, but with Arab and international support.

Abed explains that this plan stems from a profound awareness of the dangers carried by American and Israeli policies, and stresses the need to find solutions that are in harmony with the Palestinian reality and its national rights, foremost of which is the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.

Abed stresses that the five -year summit that will be held in Riyadh is of great importance, as its results will be reflected directly on the outcomes of the Arab summit in Cairo at the end of this month.

Abed stresses the need for the five -year summit to come out with a clear and comprehensive plan that the Palestinian Authority looks at, addressing the Trump administration projects, whether with regard to displacement or by re -drawing the political map of the Palestinian issue according to the Israeli vision.

Abed notes that the expected plan from the five -year summit must be based on three main axes: First, the Palestinian people are fixed on their land, the stopping of the Israeli aggression, and the attempt to rebuild the Gaza Strip; Second, drawing a clear political path that leads to ending the occupation and establishing an independent Palestinian state; And thirdly, strengthening the joint Arab diplomatic movement, including transferring the Arab position in a way United to the upcoming Arab summit and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.

Abed warns of the seriousness of any divisions in Arab and Islamic positions, noting that any variation in visions will allow the American administration and Israel to exploit these differences to impose its vision, which revolves around ending the conflict in accordance with American and Israeli interests, and holding Arab countries responsible for the Palestinian refugees, which enshrines Israeli expansion projects Under the umbrella of the so -called ""Greater Israel"".

Abed stresses that the success of the Arab plan in addressing American and Israeli plans requires a unified Palestinian position, based on presenting a comprehensive vision of what is known as the ""next day"" in the Gaza Strip.

Abed explains that the unified Palestinian position gives an additional power to the Arab position, and supports the decisions of the Arab summit in the face of American and Israeli pressures that seek to exploit the Palestinian and Arab division to impose solutions that are compatible with the ambitions of the occupation.

Abed asserts that what is required today is to unify the Arab and Islamic position, enhance joint coordination, develop a comprehensive plan that exceeds the human side and reconstruction to interfere at the heart of the Palestinian issue, through adherence By ending the occupation and establishing an independent Palestinian state with the support of the Arab countries, while emphasizing that the unity of the Palestinian and Arab ranks is the main key to the success of these efforts in the face of American and Israeli plans.",PS

"The West used to see in the Arabs a group of cunning, deceitful, tyrants, and weak, who have money and oil, but they only understand the language of strength under the title of developing and protecting their countries. This is the basic rule in which the West legitimized its Arab countries, and it was written about it and its late Palestinian thinker Edward Said in his book ""Orientalism"" (1978). This stereotypical view of the Arab world soon took a new dimension after ""September 11"" (2001), and was represented by attaching the charge of terrorism and extremism to the Arabs, and under this title as well, the occupation of the Arab land and the control of its capabilities was legalized, under the pretext of defending Western national security, to divide After a rival sectarian and sectarian groups.
For more than a year and a half ago, Western policy and Western media abuse have restored the concept of Orientalism to the fore. On the Israeli level, Israeli officials did not find the embarrassment to use this western view that exceeds the superiority to express the Arab people's contempt. The paradox, this language was accepted by acceptance and popularity, not only Western governments, but in its media Also, by describing the Palestinians, throughout the war on Gaza, often, as ""monsters"", ""human animals"", and other insulting names. This view was dedicated to the performance (media and official) in dealing with Arab voices and movements, which (and still (and is still) the Israeli genocide, by accusing everyone who supports Gaza and rejects the Israeli attacks of ""supporting terrorism"" and with ""anti -Semitism"" and ""racism"" and others Of ready accusations.
With Donald Trump's return to the presidency of the United States, the Orientalist speech was brought in all its aspects, especially in his dealings with several Arab countries that it is a source of funds that must be complied with his projects, otherwise the sword of sanctions will be shed on them and their peoples. In this context, it is necessary to draw attention to the fact that this scene indicates that all the policies adopted by some Arab countries, from openness to normalization in the name of tolerance, could not change some of this stereotype towards the Arabs.
On the Arab level, it is easy to monitor the influence of the Arab culture itself with some ideas of Orientalism theory to the point of identification with it sometimes, especially with regard to the inevitable ratification Western superiority in various fields, and a marginalization that does not stop with Western civilization, despite the richness of Arab civilization, its leadership and its role, even in the formation of the first nucleus of the Western civilizations in various fields. The Arabs believed that they are weak, and that they cannot rule themselves, and that they need, therefore, to Western guardianship, even with different addresses and forms of development and progress.
The most prominent example of the Arab humiliation of the question of Palestine, since its conquest in 1948, to the Israeli genocide war on Gaza, which brought its cruelty to the scenes of the Nakba.
The most prominent example of the Arab humiliation of the question of Palestine, since its conquest in 1948, to the Israeli genocide war on Gaza, which brought its cruelty to the scenes of the Nakba.
The effects of this culture are not limited to social, life, scientific and economic aspects, but also (and perhaps before any other aspect) in Arab political work, which is embodied in a long history of concessions and divisions due to the struggle for power and influence, which in turn opens the door wide for foreign interventions. Perhaps the most prominent example of the Arab humiliation of the question of Palestine, since its conquest in 1948, to the Israeli extermination war on Gaza, which was restored With its cruelty, the scenes of the Nakba, and a large part of the people regained real scenes of comparing them and showing the extent of their correspondence with scenes of displacement and murder against the Palestinians that occurred in Gaza. Just as the people of Palestine wagered on the Arab armies in 1948 to support them, the people of Gaza bet in this war on the Arab countries, peoples and rulers, for their relief, and to pressure their Western allies to stop the Israeli genocide against them. As in every Israeli war and attack, the invaders only found media data for more than a year and a half, and was shyly issued to calm the congestion of Arab peoples. This coincided with the disintegration of the support fronts that started from Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq, and the fall of what is known as the ""axis of resistance"", especially after Lebanon lost the war and removed it from the scene, and after the fall of the Syrian regime, knowing that the latter did not take any step to support Gaza or Lebanon During the war, on the contrary, it prevented the opening of the Golan Front in the past war, and refused to shoot one bullet on the Israeli occupation, despite all its attacks. On Syrian soil.
And since the sixties and seventies of the last century, the godfather of American diplomacy, Henry Kissinger, began implementing the policy of destroying the circumvention. And the Arab commitment in solidarity with the Palestinian issue, and by imposing a kind of Arab division by separating the Palestinian issue from its Arab association, which happened in the normalization operations that started with Egypt individually immediately after the October War (1973), to the Emirati normalization, and negotiations on Israeli normalization The Saudi, who was delayed due to October 7 (2023), the war on Gaza, and the American and Israeli statements recently about the displacement plan. During the path of normalization, work was worked to separate the Arab citizen himself from the Palestinian issue, and to remove the human and natural context of the Arab peoples' view of the principle of resisting the occupation, by implementing a policy based on the belief that confronting the occupation leads to ruin, and linking normalization to prosperity and openness.
Since the Nakba, then the setback, until today, the Arab countries have failed to confront the Israeli occupation of Palestine
Since the Nakba, then the setback, until today, the Arab countries have failed to confront the Israeli occupation of Palestine
So, since the Nakba, then the setback, until today, the Arab countries have failed to confront the Israeli occupation of Palestine, and even the Arab memory is crowded in stations Many Arabs abdicated in the interest of Israel to the extent of collusion, which made the latter not even heal the embarrassment of the ""friendly"" Arab countries, or ""allied"", or that you want to alliance with, in the media, and in social media, by underestimating the official Arab data and positions that reject plans The displacement against the Palestinians, to the point of public demand, and in the form of the preacher and the commander, from some Arab countries to receive the Palestinians to implement their plan with American support.
Yesterday, President Trump came out to reveal to the whole world the reality of the American -Israeli project since 1948, which is the displacement of the Palestinians from their land, and expanding the area of ??Israel that Trump likened himself to ""the small pen at a large table (i.e. the Arab world)."" Thus, then, under the title of reconstruction and the treatment of the humanitarian conditions of the people of Gaza, the US President gave the instrument of public approval of the ""Israeli dream"" project, and if it was later announced to delay its implementation after the wave of official Arab criticisms that followed, but without its cancellation, but rather replacing his approach with enforced terms .
Despite the importance of the official Arab alert to reject Trump and Netanyahu's statements, this scene is this scene The discussion opens on a basis, which is the loss of Arab peoples' confidence in Arab governments in standing in front of American -backed Israeli projects, despite their positive interaction in electronic spaces. Hence, throughout the years, a state of romance was formed in the years in the approach of a culture of defeat and weakness, specifically in the issue of Arab ability to deal with Israeli ambitions, and to impose effective policies to confront their attacks in Palestine. Through the Arab history, since the occupation of Palestine (1948) until the war on Gaza recently, official Arab statements did not prevent Israel from killing, attacking, destroying and settlement in Palestine, and instead of pressure to hold it accountable, some Arab countries were quick to normalize with it under the pretext of protecting Palestine and achieving the establishment of the Palestinian state. However, Israel continued its violations of all international laws, and in its promise to kill the Palestinians, and in the continued settlement and increase its pace in the past few years, in addition to the continuous attempts to Judaize Jerusalem, repeat scenes of storming the Al -Aqsa Mosque and impose the temporal and spatial division in it. And when her aggression on Gaza began more than a year ago, he did not rise The Arab position to the level of genocide that Israel was committing against the Palestinians, but rather was limited to some Arab construction situations, which are repeated at every Israeli attack, and did not prevent the Palestinian resistance to load the reason for the extermination instead of the Israeli occupation and its government, and its internationally desired president on charges of crimes against humanity.
With Trump's return to the presidency
With Trump's return to the presidency
Where is the Arabs standing today in the face of this project, which publicly threatens Arab national security, and not only by liquidating the Palestinian issue? ... There is a single diplomatic experience that must be lit, constructed, and invested in the awareness of the Arab people The war is on Gaza. This settlement is proof of the Arab peoples (before any other party) the Arab ability to confront, take the initiative, and impose our interest, account and right. As Work to consolidate the culture of defeat, waiver and weakness of Arab generations, the success of this settlement (or mediation) is a different model that must be generalized to reshape the knowledge and societal general perception of the Arab peoples, specifically the new generation that possesses the ability (or has enthusiasm) to the initiative.
It must be noted that Qatar has presented, in its role, a fundamental mediator in this deal, a new model in the literature of diplomatic work that we have not previously seen in the Arab world, the least for decades, which can be called ""human diplomacy"" or ""human diplomacy"", It was expressed by the Qatari Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani, in an interview (1/17/2025), which he started by turning to the people Gaza, asking them to forgive, ""If the State of Qatar fails for all the months that have passed,"" he added: ""Amana, we are in Qatar, the highness of the prince, and all the Qatari people, are very happy with this agreement like the joy of the people of Gaza that we saw, this happiness that we saw in the streets Gaza. We reached this result. ""
This is amazing The statements do not like to be transient, and they are not a secondary detail in light of the current Arab reality, but rather are at the heart of the Qatari presence in the Palestinian file in general, and in the war on Gaza in particular. This statement reflects an unfamiliar relationship in the Arab memory in the Palestinian issue specifically, as the Palestinian is often treated in all stations and wars as a mere file or number on the table of regional and international negotiations, which is negotiable. This emotion, which was shown by the Qatari official for the negotiation and settlement file, was news by the people of Gaza before any other people during the war, through the visits of Qatari officials to Gaza, most notably the Minister of Education for Lulwa Al -Khater, and by converting media outlets in Qatar as armies that lead the media resistance to reach the Palestinian voice to the region and the world.
The Egyptian Qatari mediation has proven the Arab ability to confront, take the initiative, impose our interest, account, and right
The Egyptian Qatari mediation has proven the Arab ability to confront, take the initiative, impose our interest, account, and right
On the Arab political level, this mediation offers several points that must be built and work To develop and generalize it, especially in the face of the American -Israeli displacement plan. First, re -consideration of Arab collective work through cooperation between Qatar and Egypt. The success of the partnership between Egypt and Qatar in concluding the agreement reopens the discussion on the importance of Arab collective action and its strength. The omission of symbolic (and the importance of) does not lie between the two countries, which must be lit and circulated, because the relations between them have gone through various crises and bumps for years, due to ideological political differences and differences. Hence, the success of this joint mediation confirms that Arab countries can respect the privacy of each other, organize differences and/or differences between them, and work for the Arab public interest, especially in the question of Palestine, which threatens Arab national security, and not only the liquidation of the Palestinian issue.
Second, for the first time, perhaps in the history of Arab mediations and agreements regarding the Palestinian issue and the Arab -Israeli conflict, Arab mediation succeeds in preserving the right of the people of the earth, by imposing the Israeli withdrawal from the entire lands in Gaza and working to complete it, and through networking to confront the obstacles that Israel places And the settlement threatens, through A diplomatic campaign led by Egypt and the follow -up of Qatari diplomatic diplomacy in mobilizing international support to provide full support to the people of Gaza, and to put Israel and America before their responsibility in implementing the entire agreement, and pressure to secure the introduction of the necessary equipment to start reconstruction, and thus drop the displacement project.
Today, the region is living in an exceptional state of momentum and pushing at the media level in rejecting the American -Israeli plan to displace the Palestinians from Gaza, but this momentum requires meals to protect it, install it, and to transform it with an effective policy, transcending media campaigns that do not lead to actual change, and does not help the people of Gaza in persistence in their land And protect them from displacement. The stability of the people of Gaza in their land needs ingredients in the introduction of aid, especially temporary houses, and in the immediate start of reconstruction. For this, in front of the Arab peoples, as their governments, are embuldens and models: either benefit from the success of the Egyptian Qatari settlement and pressure with effective steps to curb Americans and Israelis, or the fall of the Arab region again by making disguised concessions, and through drowning in construction speeches (which drowns us more in isolation from isolation from Our right And our presence), so we dedicated the failure of ""Orientalism"".",UK

Today, we review a number of comments on the future of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza and the reconstruction of the war that destroyed the war.
We start from the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which has published an editorial entitled: ""The only way to restore the hostages is to stop the war and withdraw the Israeli forces from Gaza.""
The newspaper began its editorial by referring to the return of the four hostages Sherry, Ariel, Kfir Pipas and Audid LVchitz in Tabate on Thursday, 503 days of detention.
Haaretz saw that these victims were abandoned twice: the first through an unparalleled diplomatic and military failure; The second is when the Israeli government did not do it to return them as part of a deal or agreement, according to the newspaper.
""The killing of the Israeli hostages was not a destiny, but rather the result of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decisions, which is still the courage to make a visit to the Nir Oz settlement, where these hostages were kidnapped,"" Haaretz said.
End proposed stories
The Israeli newspaper considered that this double abandonment that these Israeli hostages were exposed to should rise as a warning against the consequences of the gossip of the dedication with Hamas and the failure of Agreement.
""The return of the hostages, alive or dead, is invaluable. No one should violate this first right of citizens over their state,"" Haaretz said.
The Israeli newspaper considered that the only way to return the rest of the hostages is to continue the agreement, and to comply with its clear clauses by stopping the war and withdrawing the Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip.
Haaretz warned that ""there is no other way to ensure the return of the hostages, especially those false covenants related to achieving a complete victory, or other hateful awareness campaigns that the Prime Minister's office has consistent,"" the newspaper said.
Haaretz Netanyahu has accused of thwarting the exchange of hostages throughout the war months until now.
The Israeli newspaper concluded by saying that ""Netanyahu must now take the deal and restore all the hostages, and that the Israeli people should exert pressure to ensure that the prime minister does not betray his duty.""

It is worth the end
We move to the British Guardian newspaper, where we read an editorial on the future of Gaza, entitled: ""The ceasefire agreement The prisoners ’exchange should not fail.”
The newspaper started its editorial by saying that ""the pain and destruction that occurred over the past 16 months will remain its impact on the hearts of families and societies, and even in the whole Middle East region for decades.""
The Guardian said that ""as long as there were fears of the failure of this agreement, which was the need for an ultimate, whether for the Palestinians in Gaza or the Israelis and the kidnapped foreigners in the Strip,"" the Guardian said.
The British newspaper noted that the first six -week stage is scheduled to end on the first of next March, noting that the talks for the second stage of the agreement, which are the most complex, have not started yet, although it was supposed to start more than two weeks ago .
The Guardian saw that ""there are two sources of hope to complete the deal: The first source, is the confidence that Trump's special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkev was speaking about a week ago that the second stage will inevitably begin.""
As for ""the second source of hope, it is that the Hamas movement said that in the second stage it will release all the remaining hostages it has at once, not on payments, as happened in the first stage of Agreement. On the other hand, the Palestinian armed movement wants Israel to withdraw completely and quickly from the Gaza Strip. ""
On the other hand, Netanyahu requires, in the second stage, that Hamas will be disarmed and ended in the Strip, according to the Guardian.
And ""Netanyahu does not want to oppose Trump, but reaching the second stage of the agreement was never in the interest of the Israeli Prime Minister,"" according to the newspaper.
In light of this, the British newspaper considered that extending the first stage is better in any case of nothing, stressing that the second stage of the agreement, which is the most difficult, will be a big step forward.
""But then, the most prominent third stage question, related to the reconstruction of Gaza,"" according to the Guardian, who saw in the announcement of President Trump regarding the establishment of the ""Middle East Rvira"" owned by the United States, is a cause for concern about the completion of the agreement.
The British newspaper pointed to the Riyadh meeting today, Friday, where Arab leaders meet to discuss an alternative plan that Egypt proposed ""in haste"", which calls on the Emirates, Qatar and other countries to finance the reconstruction of Gaza, with Hamas officially excluded from the rule of the sector and to supervise the reconstruction process.
And even if These Arab leaders have reached an applicable theoretical solution, so that President Trump is needed to persuade such a solution, ""according to the newspaper.
The Guardian concluded that ""at the present time, where the hostages are still detained, and where the circumstances in Gaza are still terrible, the priority must be represented in preserving the ceasefire agreement. Whether this agreement is suitable as a basis for a long -term solution to the crisis or not, it remains from It is now necessary to save people's lives. ""

We conclude our tour from the London Middle East, which published an article by the writer Amal Moussa, entitled ""Preparing for the Priest of the Reconstruction of Gaza.""
The author began referring to the position of the Arab and Islamic countries rejecting the displacement of the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, in which she seen a rejection of President Trump's plan to displace the Palestinians and establish the Middle East Rvira.
She said that rejecting and denounced reactions ""represent a rejection of the final elimination of the Palestinian issue, and a reminder of it.""
And she saw that ""many questions began to find their answers, and it became clear completely what was behind the aggressive shelling since October 2023, until the acceptance of the ceasefire deal.""
She explained The writer: ""We mean questions, those related to the length of the period of the Israeli aggression on Gaza, and why the insistence on destroying it completely and dropping thousands of martyrs from children, women and men. The first part of the Israeli plan is to kill what can be killed most, and the second part is the displacement of the rest that was not killed."" , She said.
Amal Moussa, the former Minister of Family, Women and Childhood in Tunisia, moved to the saying that ""in parallel with the discourse of rejection, we find a speech calling for the speedy reconstruction of Gaza, a speech that is almost unanimously gathered by all Arab leaders. We come here to the real problem.""
The writer said that ""reconstruction needs a real ceasefire, and despite the deal that took place, the excesses of Israel exist,"" and Moses' hopes asked: ""Will Israel easily allow the process of reconstruction to take place, and that its plans fail?""
""It can be said that Israel will not enable the Gaza Strip to stability that the reconstruction process needs.""
But she added: ""If the determination is strong, and awareness of the necessity of reconstruction for the Palestinians and the benefit of countries that cannot bear the displacement and its repercussions- the most important of which is the transfer of the conflict to other regions- then this calls for a word Unified, and composer is common in the Arab -Islamic space.
The writer said that ""the equation is as follows: There is an infernal plan that needs her to be a steel resolve for reconstruction.""
She concluded by saying that ""the reconstruction of Gaza is a necessity, and without that, the displacement plan will find its way. It is not acceptable for history to write that the Arab nation has excessive in the land of Palestine. Therefore, reconstruction is to cut off the road against the Palestinian routes.""",UK
"The media has reported the features of the Arab plan that will be discussed at the meeting that will be held in Riyadh tomorrow, Thursday, and will present what will be agreed upon on the Arab summit scheduled to be held in Cairo on February 27. Reuters quoted Arab officials, the most prominent contents of the plan, as it includes the formation of a Palestinian committee to rule the Gaza Strip without the participation of Hamas, international cooperation in reconstruction without the displacement of the Palestinians, in addition to moving towards a two -state solution. It also includes the establishment of a buffer zone and a barrier to obstruct the drilling of tunnels through the borders of Gaza with Egypt, and once the rubble will be removed, twenty temporary housing zones will be established, and about fifty Egyptian and foreign companies will work to complete this. A reconstruction box may also be called a ""Trump Fund for Reconstruction""! According to an Arab official, forcing Hamas to abandon any role in Gaza will be necessary, and in the same direction, the Secretary -General of the League of Arab States, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, stated the importance of Hamas that he is achieving the Palestinian interest. In other media sources, it was reported that the disarmament of the resistance in Gaza and the deportation of leaders and cadres from Hamas from the requirements of the success of the plan, and this was not confirmed by official sources. Arab, but rather, Israeli -backed Israeli demands, as there is an attempt to barter between allowing reconstruction without displacement and the head of resistance. What gives the Arab plan the importance that the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, stated that Washington is awaiting the Arab plan, and stressed the issue of removing ""Hamas"".
In a strong response to what is being circulated, the leader of ""Hamas"", Osama Hamdan, said that the position of his movement is that it will deal with any party that will exercise the role of the occupation just as the resistance dealt with the occupation, and this reflects a tension and a sense of danger, and he said that the next day in the Gaza Strip He would have been a Palestinian to be understood by the Palestinians, stressing the refusal Unless he lost half of his family, the resistance will not be accepted from anyone to say to her to step aside, stressing that the weapon of the resistance, its leaders and its relationship to its supporters are out of the discussion.
Yes, no one has the right to exclude Hamas, but all Palestinians have to give priority to saving Gaza and doing everything that can prevent the resumption of genocide, by agreeing on a plan not only from the right, but also based on wisdom, and this is achieved through national consensus Backwardly ""Hamas"" is two steps back, so that it does not participate in the government, but it is formed to understand with it, in exchange for the advancement of power two steps forward towards receiving Gaza without incapacitating conditions, and without ignoring the presence of the strong ""Hamas"", and the need for this presence because there is no void that opens the door for chaos Flenthine and fighting.
Abandoning the resistance and its weapon will weaken the Arab side and will open the way for the rejected surrender
Abandoning the resistance and its weapon will weaken the Arab side and will open the way for the rejected surrender
The foregoing means that the Arab summit is required to move differently from the previous summits, because the one who headed it under the guillotine this time is not only the Palestinian issue, but also the Arab national security, as the summit this time is in front of the moment of choice, and there are three options in front of it and each choice has its prices and consequences.
If the summit chose to challenge and confront the Trump administration, it will be exposed to various American sanctions, but it will gain their peoples and a prominent role in the region and the world, and this is through imposing unity on the Palestinians instead of excluding them, and giving priority to provide the elements of steadfastness and staying to the people of Gaza, by focusing on stopping the war of the war, And the formation of a fund for reconstruction, and the attempt to relief, recovery and reconstruction, because what will prevent displacement and limits migration in all kinds is a quick reconstruction backed by an Arab position ready to use the papers of power, political, economic and diplomatic pressure, including freezing and cutting relations with Israel, and not normalizing it if it goes on in The aggression, annexation and displacement that will not be limited to Gaza, but will extend to the West Bank, as well as the use of oil And markets and investment.
The foregoing means a confrontation that may lead to a confrontation, or to Trump's retreat from his threat to displacement and control of Gaza, because he is a practical person and not ideological, and believes in holding winning deals, and if he finds that the deal of the displacement of Gaza will lose it, it will be abandoned, and it may lead to an era of instability and confrontations.
If the Arab summit chooses to adapt and form the ""Trump Fund for Reconstruction"" in exchange for the head of the resistance, it will lose itself and its peoples, and its legitimacy will be eroded, and its stability may be shaken and its dependency will increase to the colonial West, and this encourages Trump to submit more requests regarding the Palestinian issue, or with regard to increasing Arab investments and purchases in The time of the American market, especially purchases Weapon.
There is a third option, away from confrontation and adaptation, and it is the option of resistance that allows a degree of confrontation and bargaining together, but without recklessness or failure and surrender, and it includes that the resistance retracts two steps back, but with its survival, because giving up the resistance and its weapon will weaken the Arab side and open the way In front of the rejected surrender, it cannot be acceptable and passes only when the cause of resistance is abused, which is The occupation has disappeared, and if the occupation is defeated, and an independent Palestinian state has established its capital, Jerusalem, the military wings of the resistance can be combined into one national army, and until then, the most that the resistance can offer is not to participate in the government and a long -term convection. The socket on the Arab plan will be great if the stopping of the war and reconstruction is not linked to the opening of a serious political path that begins and does not end with the Palestinian state.
The continuation of the Palestinian division in these historical moments open the door for the return of Arab and international guardianship and alternatives under Israeli supervision
The continuation of the Palestinian division in these historical moments open the door for the return of Arab and international guardianship and alternatives under Israeli supervision
The biggest dilemma is that the existential risks The issue, the land and the people threaten the Palestinian leaders and factions did not lead to unity, and there were no strong political and popular movements that are strong enough, and are able to bring about the required fundamental change, and did not lead to agreeing on a joint plan based and based on common positions, and aims to thwart the liquidation plan of the case By defeating genocide, annexation and displacement.
The continuation of the division in these historical moments open the door for the return of Arab and international guardianship and alternatives under Israeli supervision. There are sources that talk that the Riyadh meeting will not participate in a Palestinian delegation while Palestine is the subject of the research, and if that happens, it is evidence of the deterioration of the Arab position and one of the bitter division, and it is launched The beginning of fading the oneness of the representation of the Palestinians, which is the most prominent achievement that the Palestinian National Movement achieved throughout its history. Do the leaders preach it too late?
Finally, it is not realistic to expect the choice of the Arab summit confused with the American administration, because the war of genocide did not move it to take a position at the level of danger, and there is something that prevents it, and it is the network of multiple and complex relationships and ties, and thus will not turn its position. Rore now. But it is rejected to choose adaptation, as it contributes to the liquidation of the Palestinian issue and the violation of Arab national security. Therefore, it is expected, acceptable and possible to choose the entrepreneurship, especially since there are changes that change in the region and the global order, and the candidate is a change that leads to a pluralistic system, and this means an equation that is based on the one hand to stop the aggression and displacement in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and attempted reconstruction, in exchange for non -participation ""Hamas"" in the government, and the opening of a political horizon in essence is to end the occupation and embody independence, with The importance of understanding with it, it is part of the Palestinian political movement, and the force based on the Earth in the Strip, and if it is not understood with it, it is able to turn the table to everyone.",UK
"The Arab League revealed, on Saturday evening, contacts that are being held to hold an Arab summit to discuss the Palestinian issue.

This came, according to what the Assistant Secretary -General of the League of Arab States, Ambassador Hossam Zaki, stated during a phone call to the Egyptian ""Cairo News"" channel, the day after Bahrain announced its support, the proposal to hold an emergency Arab summit in Cairo, rejecting the displacement of the Palestinians.

Zaki said, ""There are current contacts to hold an Arab summit to discuss the Palestinian issue, but the date has not yet been determined.""

He pointed out that the movements of the League of Arab States aim to ""confront Israel's allegations and confirm the principle of the two -state solution.""

He stressed that ""the Arab position is coherent and everyone is behind the Palestinians, Egypt and Jordan in rejecting the issue of displacement.""

And Friday, Bahraini Foreign Minister Abdel Latif Al -Zayani told his country's official news agency, the support of Manama, the proposal to hold an emergency Arab summit in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, days after US President Donald Trump disclosed a plan to seize the Gaza Strip and displace the Palestinians from it.

As the current Arab Summit after its hosting in May 2024, Bahrain has the right to call for other emergency peaks in compliance with the rest Member States of the Arab League, according to the Anatolia correspondent.

And last Tuesday, Trump revealed a press conference that he gathered with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, his country's intention to seize Gaza after the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to other countries, before announcing Friday that he was ""not urgent"" regarding the plan on the impact of the stream of international reactions Angry.

Since last January, Trump has been promoting a plan of transferring Palestinians of Gaza to neighboring countries such as Egypt and Jordan, which was rejected by the two countries, and other Arab countries and regional and international organizations have joined them.

In identifying with the Trump plan, Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz ordered his country's army to prepare a plan to displace Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.

On January 19, a ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip and the exchange of prisoners between Hamas and Israel began in force, including 3 stages, each of which lasts 42 days, and during the first, negotiation will be made to the start of the second and the third, through Egypt and Qatar and support the United States.",PS
"Unusual, US President Donald Trump singled out the Jordanian people with a recorded and photographed with a praising King Abdullah II, and describing Jordanians as ""vital and intelligence."" The video, which was broadcast on February 12, at the expense of the White House X X, an attempt to contain the anger of the Jordanian monarch after his surprise at the entry of the journalists upon the end of his meeting with the American President, to break an agreement not to hold a press conference for them. Jordanian officials leaked Jordanian journalists and friends in Washington that Trump ""treachery with the king"", especially since the king was confused, and answered in a mysterious way that raised anxiety and resentment between Jordanians who expect clear statements that categorically reject Trump's proposal to forced displacement of more than a million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Jordan. Even if Jordanians expressed their concerns that the king intends to agree to Trump's vision, and public confusion lasted for two hours, which required the king declaring an unambiguous position, reaffirming ""the refusal to displace the Palestinians to Jordan."" However, he added the position in which Trump put, and he wrote on his account on ""X"": ""I prepared confirming Jordan's fixed position against the displacement of the Palestinians in Gaza The West Bank. This is the unified Arab position.
The sequence of events was large, and there are many lessons; The Jordanian street is highly sensitive to every letter that the king is said or said about Trump's proposals to turn Gaza into a real estate project after the forced displacement of the Palestinians to Jordan, they do not see a deportation process from Gaza only, but they see it as an introduction to forced displacement of the Palestinians from the West Bank and East Jerusalem, in preparation for the inclusion of most of the West Bank And Jordan Valley and the disposal of the Palestinians by expelling them to Jordan, which means liquidating the Palestinian issue at the expense of Jordan And the Palestinians. It is one of the most sensitive issues among the Jordanian people. The Zionist saying, which was repeated by the leading Zionists and Israeli officials, is past and present, that Jordan is the alternative homeland for the Palestinians, is still stuck in the minds of Jordanians and Palestinians together, and constitutes a permanent concern for the Jordanians that the Israeli and American plan requires the end of the Jordanian entity And the Jordanian identity, one of the conditions End the Palestinian issue and the rights of the Palestinians. The headlines of the Jordanian newspapers were In the 1970s, its 1980s, and the early 1990s, a warning of the ""Transfer"" plan, a deceptive Israeli expression taken from the word ""transfer"" from one place to another in English, but it means in practice the expulsion of the Palestinians from the West Bank to Jordan.
King Abdullah II gained unprecedented popularity and support for his position that refused to displace the Palestinians to Jordan, but he is supported by the continuation of his position regardless of what the Arabs decide in their next meeting.
King Abdullah II gained unprecedented popularity and support for his position that refused to displace the Palestinians to Jordan, but he is supported by the continuation of his position regardless of what the Arabs decide in their next meeting.
... In 1989, the wave of the migration of the Soviet Jews began to Israel, after the weakness and collapse Abdel -Gawad Saleh launched an Arab and international campaign to prevent displacement. Even the Arab summit in Baghdad in 1990 called for the endowment of the migration of the Soviet Jews to Palestine, while Israel continued in Building settlements, withdrawing the identities of the people of East Jerusalem, removing militants, and destroying homes in a continuous process. This means that the scheme is not new, but it took a dangerous approach with the most extremely powerful oath in Israel and the escalation of recent destruction and expulsion and unprecedented from the Jenin camp and other regions. In the sense that the ""Transfer"" plan has started to be implemented, for Jordanians and Palestinians. The Trump proposal came to confirm, or at least deepening, Jordan's concern that there is international approval under various names to displace the Palestinians to it.
A return to what is happening now, King Abdullah II has gained unprecedented popularity and support for his position that refuses to displace the Palestinians to Jordan, but it is supported by the continuation of his position regardless of what the Arabs decide in their next meeting. Despite the existence of popular support for lack of acceptance, and even rejection, there is a deep fear that the king's resolve is disturbed if he does not find support from Egypt and Saudi Arabia in particular. It is true that the American establishment did not adopt the Trump proposal, but it took advantage of it to throw the ball in the Arab stadium to lure them to bargaining and accept proposals no less dangerous, not the least of which is the normalization of relations with Saudi Arabia and ensuring Arab cooperation to remove Hamas from the Gaza circle in Gaza.
Palestine and Jordan are flooding the same danger to Palestine, the enemy is Israel, and Trump's sudden kindness does not change the support of Washington.
Palestine and Jordan are flooding the same danger to Palestine, the enemy is Israel, and Trump's sudden kindness does not change the support of Washington.
Therefore, the American Foundation, whether in the Democratic and Republican parties, or experts in Washington who influence their decision, persuaded Trump to retreat from what appeared to be a deliberate insult to the king, so voices began to emphasize the importance of the king and Jordan's strategic role and the need not to tamper with Jordan's stability, at least now, everyone is everyone He sees a role that may differ from what Trump thinks, as perceptions are formulated The research centers and the influencing departments in Washington put it in that Jordan takes a role in managing the Gaza Strip, and pressing the Palestinian Authority by ending all armed resistance organizations, that is, Jordan has the security decision in the West Bank, even without sending the Jordanian army to the West Bank, which explains Even partly, the ""gift"" of decision -making circles and insistence that Trump take a step in which he expresses The king's respect, so he said in his recorded speech that the king is one of the most important leaders in the world.
Regardless of the goals of the ""favoritism"" campaign of the king and Jordan in Washington, what indicated the importance of the Kingdom and its strategic location, which strengthens its position, as there is no alternative to walking in the path of protecting Jordan and collapsing from the Israeli displacement plans. The pursuit in Washington aims to reach an Israeli -Arab normalization, ending the Palestinian issue, even if the forced displacement of the Palestinians from the West Bank in particular requires, and Jordan is involved in a role that threatens its stability and sovereignty, because Washington's priority is to protect Israel and ensure its hegemony.
Internally, the internal front must be seriously strengthened, and all opinion -minded opinion should be released regardless of the end of their provisions or not, and to make way for partisan, trade union and national actors to express the utmost freedom from its opinion. The government must silence the voices of ""writers"" and reinforce the ""electronic flies"" supported by certain wings from the state and stop inciting the Palestinians as if they were the reason for the forced Israeli displacement of the Palestinian people. Palestine and Jordan are overflowing the same danger, the enemy is Israel, and does not change Trump's kindness Suddenly, Washington's support for Israel.",UK

Hours later, the Russian news agency TASS quoted the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, that the preparations for a Russian-American summit may take several months, but the two sides agreed that Riyadh may be the ""appropriate place"" to meet.
Trump-Putin's connection and what was announced that they could hold a summit in Saudi Arabia, which the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs welcomed, and confirmed its continued efforts to achieve permanent peace between Russia and Ukraine, which started since the outbreak of the crisis, noting that the Crown Prince had previously expressed the Kingdom's readiness to make its endeavors To reach a political solution to the crisis.

It is worth the end
The Vice President of the Middle East Institute in Washington, Paul Salem, believes that the choice of Saudi Arabia as a possible location to hold the Trump-Potin meeting is due to its neutral place.
Salem adds in an interview with BBC Arabic that the matter was possible in Western Europe, but the atmosphere today is not neutral in the Ukrainian-Russian issue in particular, in addition to that Saudi Arabia is from During its strong relationships with Trump and his first and current administration, and her strong relationships with Putin, it is a possible place to meet away from the tensions in Europe.
As for the professor of international relations, d. Abu Diab's risks, indicating that Geneva or other neutral European cities were usually chosen for such meetings, but the deterioration of Moscow's connections with Switzerland and the change of the positions of some European countries, made this choice more likely, especially since Saudi Arabia succeeded in weaving confidence and mutual interests With Putin, as well as she is not a member of the International Criminal Court.
In 2023, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin, on charges of a war crime against the background of the war in Ukraine.
According to some of the followers, Putin can travel to Saudi Arabia to hold talks without risking his arrest.

Followers say that during the past years, Saudi Arabia has been able to prove its position as a major player in global diplomacy, and has recently succeeded in mediating the exchange of prisoners between Russia and Ukraine, which earned it the confidence of the two parties.
The last of these mediations that led to an exchange deal for prisoners, according to which Russia released the American teacher, Mark Vogel, after he was imprisoned for more than three years, and ""the Saudi crown prince had an effective role in his launch,"" said the American Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkev.
Saudi Arabia also received Zelinski and Putin on several occasions, and sought to reach a solution that leads to a permanent peace between the two countries, and hosted a meeting in Jeddah for representatives of a number of countries.
During Putin's visit to Riyadh in December 2023, Bin Salman described him as ""a very special and dear guest of Saudi Arabia and people.""
The academic specialist in international relations, Gulf and Middle East, Abdullah Baaboud, believes that the Kingdom is seeking to play the role of the mediator while other countries were playing this role, such as the Sultanate of Oman, Qatar and the Emirates, and he says to the BBC News Arabic that it ""was able to emerge in major topics,"" describing it as ""part of the soft power it uses to establish its position as an important regional state in the world.""
In the opinion of Baaboud, Saudi Arabia's hosting of a summit meeting may be a US diplomatic gift in exchange for urging it to enhance its involvement in the Abrahamic agreements.
As for the Vice President of the Middle East Institute in Washington, Paul Salem, he says that Trump is seeking to strengthen his relations with Saudi Arabia for economic and strategic reasons, and he is seeking an American-Saudi-Israeli agreement one day.
The expert in strategic affairs, Brigadier General Hassan Al -Shehri, believes that the choice of Trump and Putin for Riyadh is a place to meet them, because they know that it is the most appropriate for preserving balanced relations with all countries, as it is ""a strong and impartial diplomatic medium"" for many regional and international challenges and threats and has succeeded.
Al -Shehri adds that Saudi Arabia realizes that the success of the summit will cast a shadow over many areas of tension around the world, including the Palestinian issue, because of this region of great importance to the two forces - that is, the United States and Russia.
As for the professor of strategic communication and relationships Government, d. Nidal Shukair, he sees that Saudi Arabia is an important country for Trump's policies in the Middle East, especially when talking about the Palestinian issue and the century's deal that he is trying to pass, and which may have repercussions on the Arab and Islamic world if it goes forward.
In this context, Choucair points out to the American pressure that was exerted on Saudi Arabia in the recent period and the prime minister of Israel's statement about the transfer of the people of Gaza to the Kingdom if it wants to establish a Palestinian state and the official Saudi statements that were rejected.

The United States is the largest oil producer in the world, followed by Saudi Arabia and Russia.
Given the influence of the Russian -Ukrainian war on global energy markets, experts indicate that Saudi Arabia has played a role in maintaining the stability and balance of oil markets.
Abdullah Baaboud says that Saudi Arabia and Russia intersect their interests as the major oil producers, and the relationship between them has helped to conclude several agreements within the OPEC Plus alliance, and it is expected that the Trump-Putin summit will focus not only on the end of the Ukraine war, but also on global oil and economic cooperation .
He adds that Trump may seek to secure oil prices Preference for American energy companies, especially after he called for lowering prices.
Baaboud says that Trump's policy is focused on extracting oil at the expense of clean renewable energy, which is brings it closer to Saudi Arabia, as it is one of the largest oil producers, who says at the inauguration ceremony, ""Dug my dear! Drill Baby Drill""
Abdullah Baaboud notes that the first external visit to Trump during his first term was to Saudi Arabia, which gave the Kingdom a diplomatic position in line with its ambitions, in light of competition with other regional countries.
Trump has already hinted that his first external visit in his second term may be again to the kingdom, but he set a condition for it.
""If Saudi Arabia wants to buy 450 or 500 billion, I think I will often go there,"" he said last January.
Then the Saudi Crown Prince called him, confirming the Kingdom's desire to expand its investments and commercial relations with the United States in the next four years, with an amount of $ 600 billion, a candidate for the rise.
But Trump, during the World Economic Forum in Davos, said: ""I will ask the Crown Prince, a wonderful person, to raise The amount to almost a trillion dollars. ""
He added, ""I think they would do it because we were very good with them.""
On this topic, a professor of strategic communication and government relations, d. Nidal Shukair, Trump chose Saudi Arabia to be his main strategic partner politically and economically through investments.
In the opinion of Shukair, the American trend is to obtain a great way to partnership with the Gulf states, especially Saudi Arabia, specifically after strategic diversity and openness in the east during the Biden era.
He talks about a Saudi warning of the ""second version of Trump"", and says that the Kingdom will not put an end to its relations with China in particular, but the Trump administration seeks to have the largest share in certain controls and margins.
Dr. Abu Diab's risks also when Trump strives for the American competitive strategy with China to try to influence and emphasize the historical American influence in the Kingdom and its vicinity. .
Followers say that a strong personal relationship arose between Bin Salman and Trump, and between him and Putin, This is what Trump publicly said: ""Putin and I know the Crown Prince well"" ...
Dr. Abu Diab's risks that the good relationship between Trump and Bin Salman belongs to his first mandate, and Trump's son -in -law was the coordinator of the relationship that developed in that era, as the Saudi Crown Prince was the first foreign leader to speak to Trump returning to the White House.
The human rights file has always been a challenge for Saudi Arabia and remained under the microscope despite the announcement of the initiation of a number of reforms.
In this context, Abu Diab says that the Kingdom has its interests with Washington and took great steps its cultural revolution and improving the human rights record according to Western standards, and therefore this file has no significant impact in the time of Trump's ""imperialist"" presidency, as he put it.
Shuqair also considered that the Kingdom's image has improved a lot in recent years, and this was in isolation from the political pressures that the Biden administration exerted.
He adds that human rights become a political tool in the interests of the major countries. When there is political cooperation, the existence of this political tool is negated and therefore the pressure does not exist.",UK

Tawfiq Tohmeh: Trump's statements are not just a ""test balloons"" but rather a real threat that meets with Israeli ambitions

The statements of US President Donald Trump regarding the displacement of the residents of the Gaza Strip, and his conversion to ""Rvira East"" are still echoing, despite the wide reactions and rejecting such statements, even from within the United States and many of its European allies, China, Russia, the Arab countries, the Palestinian Authority and the countries of America Latin. There are those who see the implementation of such The American plans are a matter of force, and therefore voices were suggested that it be made incentives to the people of the Strip to encourage them to immigrate voluntary.

A book, analysts and diplomats spoke to ""?"" that they said that the storm ""raised by Trump began to recede because of the international, Arab and Palestinian opposition, and even from some moderates in America, stressing that the forced displacement of an entire people has nothing to do with peace, but rather a flagrant violation of international law, humanitarian principles and justice, And that the confrontation of the displacement is through strengthening Palestinian unity, ending the division and unifying institutions between Gaza and the West Bank.

They emphasized that the world must categorically reject any proposal that seeks to impose solutions by force, and the countries that have not yet been expressed in their position on Trump's calls for displacement must be urged until they initiate a declaration of their refusal to displace and annexation, in accordance with international law and international legitimacy resolutions.

Trump's comments on the displacement of Gazans are an extension of the ""Deal of the Century""

Maher Abdel Qader, an expert in international relations, said that US President Donald Trump's statements regarding the displacement of the Palestinians of Gaza and the construction of ""Rivera"" are in their place, is an extension of the plan of the ""Deal of the Century"" that he launched during his first presidential term Under the slogan of peace, but its real goal was to strengthen the interests of Israel, and to enable its control over the entire Palestine and the Golan Heights, in addition to other lands, in exchange for providing humanitarian and economic services to the Palestinians without meeting their legitimate political rights.

He pointed out that this proposal was met with wide rejection in the past, and is still rejected until now.

Abdel -Qader explained that the Palestinian people have been subjected to forced deportations since the beginning of the migration of the Zionist Europeans to Palestine, and the declaration of the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, where this period witnessed the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, then the deportations were repeated in 1967. History also witnessed repeated attempts to settle the Palestinians. Outside their homeland, the most prominent of which is the 1955 campaign led by the Israelis, the Americans and the British, but it failed, as Similar attempts have failed in the sixties and seventies of the last century.

Abdel -Qader added: Israel and its allies also sought to push the UNRWA agency to develop a motivational and compensatory program to encourage the Palestinians to migrate, but this project has failed due to political complications and Palestinian and Arab popular resistance.

A crime of war and crime against humanity

He indicated that Trump's recent statements regarding the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, which is considered in international law a war crime and a crime against humanity, aimed at strengthening his popularity between the pro -Israel base, especially the Zionist lobby and the evangelical Christian Christians, who donated his election campaign hundreds of millions of dollars.

He said: ""These statements also aim to exert pressure on Egypt, Jordan and other countries to assume additional responsibilities towards the Palestinian refugees, with the aim of uprooting the Palestinians from their land, canceling their cause, alleviating the political, economic and security burdens on Israel, and turning it into a"" extreme, reserved religious state "", as it was Always by the United States. ""

Abdel -Qader saw that Trump began to retract his plan hours after its announcement, as his foreign minister, Marco Rubio, stated that Trump's goal of transporting the population is to enable the United States to remove the rubble and destruction in Gaza, indicating that there are 35 thousand tons of weapons that Israel brought down. On the sector and did not explode.

The Palestinians who told the displacement in 1948 will not leave their land

Abdel -Qader considered that this statement is a political blackmail, because the Palestinians who They have been displaced since 1948, they realize that migration is a one -way way without the right to return, and therefore this trick will not be deceived. The US Secretary of Defense also confirmed that there is no plan to deploy the American army in Gaza.

Abdel -Qader added: The ""Zouna"" raised by Trump began to decline because of the international, Arab and Palestinian opposition, and even some moderates in the United States, although these statements were welcomed by extremist settlers, who have become considered an idea that must be established, especially after it was adopted publicly By an American president and members of his administration and Congress, without hesitation or shame.

Abdel -Qader stressed that the Palestinian people staying in their land, strengthening their struggle, and adhering to the right to self -determination and establishing an independent state with its capital, Al -Quds Al -Sharif, with the failure to drop the claim for the right to return, requires a supportive Arab consensus, especially from Saudi Arabia, which the United States demands to normalize without charge To the position of Egypt and Jordan rejecting any solution that detracts from Palestinian rights.

He also stressed that the international concert, which showed an explicit rejection of the displacement and the re -offering of a two -state solution, along with the unification of the Palestinian ranks, is The way to thwart the Trump project and the extreme right plans in Israel.

Abdel -Qader considered that the real battle now is the battle for the reconstruction of Gaza, warning that keeping the aid is scarce, and not starting the reconstruction, will push the Palestinians in the Strip to live in a deadly hell between the rubble and tents that will not stand long in front of the changing weather conditions.

Surprising positions that are not related to international and human relations

For his part, Ali Al -Marbi, Secretary -General of the Arab Journalists and Writers Union in Europe, said that since his arrival in power last January, US President Donald Trump has taken surprising positions that are not related to international and human relations.

He pointed out that among these positions is what he announced a few days ago about the necessity of the Palestinian people from Gaza to Egypt and Jordan, and later to other countries.

Al -Murabi described this statement as dangerous and unprecedented and contradicts international law and human rights, and falls within the framework of racial discrimination and war crimes against the Palestinian people.

He said: So, in front of these decisions, which Donald Trump makes strangely and is not related to international norms and international law, which requires respect for the rights of peoples It is subject to occupation, there are international laws that protect people who fall under foreign occupation, and this is largely applied to the Palestinian people who have been suffering from the Zionist occupation since 1948.

The position of the Arab countries is clear and rejecting the displacement of the Gazans

Al -Murabi believes that the Arab countries were clear, and we hope that they always emphasize their opposition position to displace Palestinian brothers from their land in the Gaza Strip.

He added: We also hope that the international community will move urgently to prevent the commission of these crimes that aim to evacuate the Gaza Strip from its people and its residents.

He stressed that the world was surprised by decisions against the International Criminal Court, which was taken by President Trump, which was to impose sanctions on members of the International Criminal Court, seize their money, and prevent their entry into the United States.

He said: It was not limited to the members of the court only, but also included everyone who cooperates with it or provides any evidence for it.

The continuation of instability in the Arab East

Al -Murabi explained that these fiercely aggressive policies that Donald Trump ultimately leads to strengthening the Zionist occupation on the Arab land of Palestine, and prevent, in one way or another, the establishment of a Palestinian state according to the decisions. International on the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This will lead to the continuation of the crisis and the continuation of instability in the Arab East and Palestine.

Al -Marbi stressed the need for the Arab countries to emphasize the American leadership that their rejection of these decisions and wrong political trends, and to continue their support for the Palestinian people to obtain their legitimate and legal rights, including the establishment of an independent Palestinian state whose capital, Al -Quds Al -Sharif, is at least according to the Arab initiative that was approved at the summit conference Arabic in the year 2002 in Beirut, which was titled ""The Earth for Peace"".

Al -Murabi concluded his statement by saying: ""We reiterate our standing by the Palestinian people in their national options, and support his struggle for the establishment of his independent state with full sovereignty.""

Trump's proposal ignores the basic principles of international law

In turn, Vera Babon, the Ambassador of the State of Palestine in Chile, said: “In an unprecedented and deeply concerned statement, US President Donald Trump presented a distinctive peace solution, in which he calls for forced displacement of more than two million Palestinians from Gaza and the official annexation of a part of the Palestinian territories Occupied in the West Bank, To facilitate the expansion of Israeli settlements.

Babon pointed out that Trump's proposal ignores the basic principles of international law and human rights, while recalling the policies of the colonial era that give priority to regional expansion on the rights and existence of the Palestinian people.

And she saw that these statements related to the forced displacement of the Palestinians from Gaza raised the official and public opinion in Chile, where the Chilean Foreign Ministry confirmed in a post on the X -plat Regional and guarantee of peace is only the two -state solution.

Chilean President: Palestine for the Palestinians without colonies

She added: ""This statement was exchanged between the Prime Minister Alberto Van Claverrin and the President of the Republic himself Gabriel Burik, who in turn stressed on the same platform that"" Palestine for the Palestinians without external invasions, colonies or displaced persons. Two complementary and sovereign states, and have internationally recognized borders.

Ambassador Babon added, ""In a statement published by the Palestinian community in Chile, in which she confirmed that"" it is unacceptable that the insistence on expelling the Palestinians will continue. Their land and imposing a foreign rule on the Gaza Strip, after a year of terror, genocide and war crimes against the Palestinian people. This is no less than the consolidation of the occupation and the denial of the unusual right of the Palestinian people in self -determination.

The community stressed that ""in front of this new attack on the rights of the Palestinian people, the international community can no longer be limited to rhetorical statements. We need to take concrete measures to prevent the imposition of illegal measures that lead to the establishment of colonialism, forced displacement and systematic violence. In this context, we welcome In the statement of our government and we call on other countries to clearly condemn these statements and enhance diplomatic measures effectively in the international forums that demand By compliance with international law and protecting the Palestinian people.

Babon pointed out that the former Chilean diplomat Jose Rodriguez Elegendo published a message in which he answered the publication of the Chilean President Borik in the Mirocorio newspaper: “We are a very marginal state so that we cannot take the initiative against the Trump administration in the event of a possible displacement of the Gaza residents. It seems to me that this is like An ideological show puts us in the direct spotlight. Goodbye to exempt the visa. Shakia is whether we realize that in this way we ""increase the severity of contradictions"", as they said in the Leninist lexicon. ""

Chile condemnation of Trump's statements was not exceptional or isolated

He replied with a message published in the newspaper itself from Senator Francisco Shahwan, Evan Morrieh and the Joshouses of Ansolsa, members of the Foreign Policy Committee in Parliament, that ""his call to amend this position based on the current accounts is nothing more than an invitation to abandon the leadership of our country and the doctrine of the Chilean state that exceeded governments in power, on The basis of adherence to international law. For the interests of foreign powers, the most important interest of our country is to defend international law. Taking adaptive positions, as Rodriguez Elegendo proposed only to weaken our position in the world and undermine the credibility of our foreign policy. Or isolated, it was similar to the position of the vast majority of the countries of the world, including the United Kingdom and France Germany, which rejected President Trump's illegal proposal Which involves the forced displacement of the Palestinians from their lands.
She emphasized that the forced displacement of an entire people has nothing to do with peace, but rather a clear and clear violation of international law, humanitarian principles and justice.

Babon saw that the world should categorically reject any proposal that seeks to impose solutions by force, and we urge the countries that have not yet expressed their position on these calls until they initiate a declaration of their rejection of displacement and annexation, in accordance with international law and international legitimacy decisions.

Seeing the populist right in the United States

The writer and researcher Mansour Abu Karim stressed that US President Donald Trump's insistence and statement on the displacement of the people of the Gaza Strip reflects the vision of the populist right in the United States.

Abu Karim pointed out that this current, which is represented by Trump, deals with international politics and rights in the logic of commercial deals, as he sees matters from the point of view of possession, buying and selling.

He explained that this logic is not correct with international relations or with international law, and reflects ignorance of the nature of the struggle and historical rights of the Palestinian people, considering that Trump's statements are merely a ""soap bubble"" that will not have a major impact on the Palestinian-Israeli political reality. As happened with what is known as the Century deal.

Abu Karim added: ""The issuance of this position on the head of the largest country in the world is a disregard for international law and historical rights of the Palestinian people, as well as being contradictory to the system of international legitimacy decisions.""

The researcher pointed out that this trend enhances the logic of commercial deals in international relations, and paves the way for a new stage based on expelling the Palestinians from their lands and displacing them in favor of economic projects and seeing the ruling religious right in Israel.

Israel considers Trump's comments an opportunity to completely get rid of the Gaza crisis

Regarding the instrument of the Israeli army minister, Yisrael Katz, to prepare plans for displacement, Abu Karim explained that Israel is taking advantage of this opportunity, and finds in Trump's vision a way to liquidate the remaining Palestinian issue through displacement or implementing what is known as the ""conflict resolution"" project, which is based on The principle of expulsion.

He added: ""The ruling right in Israel considers Trump's statements an opportunity to permanently get rid of the Gaza crisis and the population density in the Strip, especially since Gaza formed, throughout the history of the struggle, a dagger in the southern Israel.""

With regard to the possibility of the people of Gaza's accommodation in countries Other, he stressed that there is no country in the Arab or Islamic world, or even at the international level, ready to receive more than two million Palestinian citizens, considering that this will represent the largest displacement in history, and will be a crime in accordance with international law and international norms.

Abu Karim stressed that there is no willingness to Egypt, Jordan or any Arab country to receive the Palestinians, whom Trump is seeking to displace them from the Gaza Strip.

Fear of returning to the war to implement the project of the displacement by force

He pointed out that the confrontation of the displacement is through the strengthening of Palestinian national unity and the end of the division, the unification of institutions between Gaza and the West Bank, and allowing the return of the Palestinian Authority to assume full responsibility for the Gaza Strip as the administrative and political entity recognized by the world, and the highest interests of the Palestinian people, and withdrawal The excuses from the hand of the Israeli occupation to return to war again.

He warned that returning to the war will enable Netanyahu and Tremb to implement the displacement project through military force, adding: ""It is possible to confront the Trump project through a unified Arab and Islamic position by rejecting the idea altogether and in detail and calling for a summit Arab and Islamic in Riyadh to come up with a unified position towards this dangerous project.

As for internationally, Abu Karim believes that the International Court of Justice can be resorted to through a decision of the association, and to escalate the clash with the Trump administration and the Netanyahu government in international forums, to thwart this plan, as well as the deal of the century.

A proposal that contradicts the American political and economic interests

In turn, the author of the affairs of international institutions, Sami Misha'a, revealed that the proposal of US President Donald Trump on ""the seizure of Gaza and the expulsion of its residents"" is not just a transient permit, but rather comes within a complex political context that serves the interests of Israel, although it is not implemented.

""Trump, a man of real estate deals and commercial bodies, realizes that this proposal contradicts the political and economic interests of the United States in the region, especially in light of the Chinese and Russian competition politically and militarily.""

He pointed out that the implementation of such a plan requires American military intervention, which is not possible due to its financial cost and its legal repercussions, as well as the categorical refusal of the Palestinians of such a scenario, which means a new catastrophe.

Misha'a saw that the proposal It is not a ready plan, but rather a ""launching offering"" that gives Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an opportunity to confirm his government coalition, and the possibility of forming a unit government to avoid internal crises that threaten the survival of the entity. The occupation also gives space to reformulate the second stage of the ceasefire agreement in a way that guarantees its strategic goals.

Mashaza pointed out that the primary goal of provoking Trump's proposal is to attract a broad Arab rejection of it, so that the ""thwarting of displacement"" becomes an achievement in itself, which paved the way to offer an alternative plan represented in the reconstruction of Gaza under regional supervision, while providing economic temptations to encourage the voluntary immigration of the residents of the sector , Especially the youth category, which is what he described as ""real danger.""

Intensifying settlement and uprooting plans in the West Bank

He added: On the other hand, Israel is taking advantage of this situation to continue the settlement expansion in the West Bank, the legitimacy of the outposts, the annexation of the Jordan Valley, and the displacement of the Palestinians internally, with a focus on dismantling the camps in the northern West Bank. It also works to enhance its control of Jerusalem legally and practically, by ending the work of the Relief and Works Agency for the Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA), and to cancel the status of asylum More than 110,000 Jerusalemites, and remove any presence of camps within the city's borders.

Mashaza stressed that the American administration seeks in parallel with these steps to impose normalization with the largest possible number of Arab and Islamic countries, but it is a conditional normalization to achieve Israeli goals first, on top Return, and end ""UNRWA"".

Masha'a concluded his speech by certainly that the true challenge of the Palestinians does not lie in the positions of the Arab countries, which are governed by the accounts of interests and survival, but rather in their ability to unite their ranks and end the internal division, considering that the continuation of the division is the gap that allows the passing of Trump's, Netanyahu and their allies plans.

Masha'a concluded his speech to ""?"" by emphasizing that ""without a real Palestinian unity, the resistance trade will be a loser, and the deals of liquidating the Palestinian issue will succeed.""


An extension of old plans aimed at emptying the Gaza Strip

For his part, political analyst Tawfiq Tohmeh said: The statements of former US President Donald Trump about the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip are an extension of old plans aimed at emptying the sector of its residents, Pointing out that the Israeli occupation sought to achieve this goal for decades through repeated wars on Gaza.
Tohmeh explained that the recent Israeli aggression, which continued for more than a year, revealed the intentions of the occupation in imposing forced displacement on the residents of the Strip.

He added: ""The failure of the occupation to achieve its goals by military force prompted Trump to try to achieve it through political and economic pressure and extortion, under the pretext of reconstruction.""

Tohme stressed that Trump's statements are not just a ""test balloons"", but rather a real threat, especially since he promised Israel during his election campaign to include the West Bank, which reflects a trend towards imposing American or Israeli control on the Gaza Strip as well.

A real Palestinian national unity is required to achieve

He pointed out that the failure of these plans requires the steadfastness of the Palestinian people in Gaza, the strengthening of the resistance, in addition to achieving a real Palestinian national unity.

He criticized the continuation of the Palestinian division, stressing that Israel took advantage of this division to pass its aggressive policies in the West Bank and Gaza.

Political analyst Tohma called for a Palestinian and Arab move to confront the American-Israeli plan, by mobilizing positions International, and holding emergency sessions at the United Nations, the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to denounce these statements.

Tohme considered that the Arab popular movement is an important element in the face of these plans, pointing out that the Arab street protests may put pressure on the American administration, which takes into account the impact of popular positions on the stability of their allies in the region.

Tohme concluded by saying: The battle is not only in Gaza, but also includes the West Bank, as Israel seeks to impose the annexation scheme, which requires a unified Palestinian move to confront these dangers.",PS
"""I reaffirmed Jordan's position against the displacement of the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. This is the unified Arab position. Everyone should be the priority of Gaza without displacing its people, and dealing with the difficult humanitarian situation in the Strip.""
Thus, His Majesty, King Abd al -Thani, summarized, through a series of tweets that he posted on his page on the ""X"" website.
Yesterday, the king presented the Arab narrative towards the conflict in the region, and how to defuse the crisis in the devastating Gaza Strip, and the Arab perception of what the American president presented to empty the sector and displace its population to many countries, including Jordan and Egypt, and succeeded in transferring the Arab view towards all the files and proposals that I attended strongly on the regional and global scene recently, stressing that there is an Arab position towards it, and it will be crystallized and announced after the Arab meeting will be held Which Saudi Arabia called for.
The meeting, of course, was not easy, especially since the American president is an inaccurate person, however, during a meeting with the journalists, the king affirmed what is not a field To doubt that the interest of Jordan is a priority in any decision that will be taken on American proposals, stressing that any decision will be taken into account in the interest of Jordan.
It was quite clear that Jordan would not be inflicted on President Trump's pressures in facilitating the displacement of the Palestinians, and their assimilation on Jordanian land, even when it was offered to host only 2000 sick children, this came for humanitarian purposes, and away from the American vision to empty Gaza from its residents.
Trump, apparently, is still adhering to his ""survey solutions"" to the conflict in Palestine, which constitutes an unprecedented American escalation towards the entire region. The repercussions of Trump's proposals will not affect the Palestinians alone with fatal harm, but will constitute serious challenges for all neighboring countries, and perhaps this is what has become Arab countries are well aware of it, and thus adopt a conscious strategy to deal with them.
The Jordanian vision towards the reasons for the continued conflict in the region remained very clear for decades, and the solutions are clear and possible, and the king expressed it in all international forums, and during his global meetings and tours, as long as there is an Israeli occupation, the spark of conflict will remain, and as long as the United States and society will be The international ignores the right to establish a state Palestinian according to international decisions and inter -agreements, instability will continue to be controlled by the entire region, and threatens all global peace.
The strict Jordanian position in refusing to displace the Palestinians and resettle them in another country, is based on unnecessary constants, the first of which is an internal patriotism, by rejecting the violation of the existing demographic equation in the Kingdom, and the transfer of the conflict inward, which is a recipe ready for instability.
The second of these constants is the absolute refusal to circumvent the Palestinian right and empty the land from its people in the interest of an occupation that will not only be satisfied with Gaza, but the occupied West Bank will be the next goal, especially since ""Trump's vision"" confirms that the plans to include the occupation of the West ""will be successful"", as he put it.
The world feels the great shock of the way the US President draws his ""private map"" of the region, and how he deals with peoples as groups that can be transferred to anywhere and seized their lands without their will. This is not a recipe for ending the conflict, but rather a typical way to fuel it and destroy the entire region.
Optimistic that the Arab meeting in Saudi Arabia will find a position on Trump's proposals, and there will be a clear and unified Arab message from it, Today, all Arab countries are threatened with their stability.

"The attention is directed to the emergency Arab summit that will be held on the twenty -seventh of this month in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, and is seen to be a milestone in the history of Arab positions towards the Palestinian issue.

A book, political analysts, specialists and university professors, in separate conversations with ""?"" dot com, stresses that in light of the escalation of challenges facing the Palestinian issue and even the surrounding Arab countries, the summit highlights a decisive opportunity to reject American and Israeli policies that aim to liquidate the Palestinian issue and impose unilateral solutions. It is suitable for the aspirations of the Arab peoples, between supporting Israeli settlement and expansion.

They point out that the Arab countries find themselves in light of these serious challenges, in front of a real test of their unified position, as American statements about the displacement of Palestinians to other countries in the region have increased, which constitutes a direct threat to Arab national security.

The writers, analysts, specialists and university professors believe that this summit may carry a glimmer of hope if the verbal escalation is translated into practical steps, as the summit is an opportunity to show the Arab power in the face of American pressure, stressing that the summit is if it succeeds in unification Arab ranks on firm positions, as it has been a shift in the regional role of Arab countries, which contributes to the re -drawing of the map of political and economic alliances, while confirming the Palestinian right to self -determination and the establishment of an independent state.

An Arab message in the face of the Trump administration challenge

Dr. Saeed Shaheen, a professor of political media at Hebron University, is the importance of the next emergency Arab summit, despite the lack of confidence in the outcomes of the successive Arab summits and the inability of the regimes to implement its decisions.

Despite these reservations, Shaheen believes that this summit carries a glimmer of hope, and is considered a message from the Arab countries to the Trump administration challenging their will, in which it rejects the projects of displacement and resettlement that aim to liquidate the Palestinian issue at the expense of other Arab countries.

Shaheen explains that these projects have tried to impose on decades for decades for the occupation state because of their absolute bias, have been rejected and conclusively were categorized by the Arab system.

""This summit is an opportunity to show a unified and solid Arab position in the face of Trump and Netanyahu, who seek to achieve biblical prophecies about Greater Israel, and the satisfaction of Zionist fascism by adopting its positions, which are supported by the right -wing Israeli society led by Netanyahu, Bin Ghafir, and Bamliel Smotrich.

Shaheen stresses the need for the Arab summit outputs to include waving the rejection of the continued existence of American bases in the Arab region, and the threat of its vital interests in the Arab region if it continues to support Israeli policies, to present ideas contrary to the principle of the two -state solution and the Arab peace initiative and disguised to the rights of the unusable Palestinian people.

Shaheen notes that what is required of this summit is more than a diplomatic movement. Rather, it is necessary to refuse to visit Washington and threaten to cut ties with the American administration if it continues to adopt the language of threats and promises towards Arab countries, as well as strengthening relations with countries such as China, Brazil Russia and India, which is Countries that reject the American ejaculation and support the Palestinian right.

Regarding the Palestinian position, Shaheen asserts that the file of ending the division and achieving national reconciliation between the Fatah and Hamas movements must be a priority, stressing the importance of responding to the outputs of reconciliation dialogues, the last of which is the Beijing statement.

Shaheen says: ""Who It is necessary to achieve national unity, and to develop a consensual struggle program that includes all Palestinian powers, as well as the PLO reform to be an inclusive of all Palestinian political spectrums.

Shaheen calls for the activation of the popular resistance, and the Palestinian society went to the brothers and friends in the world to address Israeli plans by respecting international law, decisions of the Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly.

Translate data and attitudes into practical actions
The writer and political analyst Mohamed Hawash confirms that the Arab summit that will be held in Cairo at the end of this month comes at a very important time, in light of the increasing Israeli escalation and the statements of US President Donald Trump that are concerned about the projects that aim to displace the Palestinians under the slogan ""Solving the Palestinian issue "".

Hawash warns that the summit should be more than just political data or traditional positions, but rather should be translated into practical acts that pressure the Israeli occupation and fail the US President's plans.

Hawash explains that the recent statements made by Netanyahu, in which he called on Saudi Arabia to provide lands to the Palestinians to establish their state, is prepared A serious transgression of the rights of the Palestinian people and an infringement of international law.

Hawash says: ""The current Israeli policy, which strengthens Trump's positions, goes beyond even the right of the Palestinians to self -determination and establish their state on their lands, but rather seeks to solve the Palestinian problem at the expense of the Arabs and by asking them to help move the Palestinians to lands other than their lands.""

Hawash warns that the continuation of the unlimited American support for Israel means that the Arab countries are facing a major challenge in dealing with these policies, as the American administration, led by Trump, seeks to impose a new reality on the Palestinian land that reflects the interests of Israel, which threatens not only the Palestinians, but also security Arab national.

Hawash says: ""The Arab summit must clearly reject the American and Israeli statements and measures that seek to liquidate the Palestinian issue, and to reject localization and displacement projects that pose a serious threat to the Palestinian presence.""

Hawash believes that the Arab summit should not be limited to rejection only, but also witnessing a practical move represented in imposing sanctions on the Israeli occupation, and working to strengthen the internal Palestinian front, in addition to Take concrete steps to support the Palestinian economy and activate popular resistance.

Hawash confirms that the Arab countries possess many strengths that can be used in the face of the Israeli -backed Israeli project, such as the ability to control the prices of oil and gas that enter the vehicles of all manufactured goods, the strategic geographical location, as well as the large Arab market that exceeds 400 million people .

Hawash considers that the use of these papers can contribute to the face of Western support for Israel, and it constitutes an element of pressure on Western countries to reconsider their policies towards the Israeli occupation.

Hawash confirms that the Arabs today possess a great economic and strategic power through which they can face American pressure, especially since the Arab countries consider the main player in the corridors of international trade between East and West, which gives them the ability to impose their positions on the international scene.

""If Israel and the United States see it to change reality through threats and pressure, then the Arabs must unite and show strength in practical situations,"" said Hawash.

Hawash notes that the upcoming Arab summit is a decisive test The Arab world has to protect the rights of the Palestinian people, stop Israeli expansion, and confront American hegemony.

""The summit will not be just talk, the summit must be this time that translates the practical steps into diplomatic positions and economic measures that impose on Israel and the United States to respond seriously,"" says Hawash.

And he stresses that the emergency Arab summit will be decisive in determining the political future of the Palestinian issue and the Arab role in the confrontation with the Israeli threats backed by Trump.

Hawash affirms that the true power of the Arab countries is embodied in their ability to organize, plan and implement decisions that put the rights of Palestinians at the core of their priorities, and not just statements that do not bring real change on the ground.

Hawash stresses the importance of Arab countries being serious in the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip away from international pressure, stressing that the Arab countries are able to take this decision without the need for the approval of Israel or the United States.

""If the western countries, especially the United States, are trying to hinder the reconstruction of Gaza, the Arabs must take practical steps that enables them to The rebuilding of the sector in their hands, and that they explicitly announce that there is no place in the future for Western domination in the Palestinian issue. ""

Regarding the internal Palestinian situation, Hawash indicates the need for the Arab summit to push the Palestinian reconciliation and form a strong national unity among all Palestinian factions, while emphasizing the role of the PLO as a custody of the national project.

Hawash stresses the need for the Arab summit to impose a trend that leads to the abandonment of Hamas from the authority in Gaza, and to merge as a basic compound in the PLO to remove the pretexts in front of relief and reconstruction operations.

Hawash says: ""The unity of the Palestinian position is the first step towards facing Israeli plans, and there must be a unified Palestinian move, especially in light of the increasing international support for the Palestinian issue.""

A sensitive and complex stage

The writer and political analyst Mohamed Gouda explains that the upcoming Arab summit, which will be held in Cairo at the end of this month, comes in a sensitive and complex stage, in light of the ongoing developments in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and the statements that followed at the last Trump-Netanyahu summit in the White House, What the occupation is trying to impose from a new reality On the ground.

It is likely that the political discourse at the next summit will be ascending, but the most important question is: ""Will this escalation be translated into a practical move, or will the language remain traditional framework?""

Gouda notes that the current data indicate attempts to introduce a new language that reflects the deteriorating reality, with the possibility of escalating statements, but it confirms that the actual outputs will remain dependent on the balances of Arab interests.

""Today, it is not enough to issue statements of condemnation or emphasis on the constants, but rather practical decisions are required to be translated into actual steps that support Palestinian steadfastness and impose a cost on the occupation in exchange for its aggressive policies.""

Gouda notes that Israel is seeking to impose a de facto policy, by displacing the Palestinians and changing the demographic character of the Palestinian territories, including Gaza, the West Bank and Jerusalem, especially in the wake of US President Donald Trump's statements about displacement and possession of Gaza.

Jouda confirms that facing these ambitions requires working on several levels, Palestinian, Arab and international.

Gouda stresses the need to strengthen Palestinian national unity to confront the occupation plans and activate the popular resistance in various Its forms, as well as strengthening economic and social resilience, and that the Palestine Liberation Organization and its government assume fully responsible for the Gaza Strip as an integral part of the Palestinian state.

It calls on the quality of the Arab countries to shift from the circle of denunciation to take practical steps, such as imposing economic sanctions on the occupation, activating the tools of political and diplomatic pressure, as well as supporting the Palestinians financially and logistically, and pressure for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip.

Joudeh notes the importance of investing the increasing international support for the Palestinian issue, working to pursue the occupation legally in international courts, and strengthening international alliances with countries rejecting Israeli policies.

And Jouda confirms that facing the Zionist ambitions requires a shift in action and not only in statements, as the occupation takes advantage of the absence of decisive responses to pass its aggressive plans.

A fundamental shift in the positions of Arab countries

The professor of political science, Dr. Suhail Diab, believes that the emergency meeting that the Arab League called on the 27th of this month reflects a unified Arab position in the face of American-Israeli plans to re-draw the map of the Middle East to serve Israeli interests alone.

Diab explains that this step represents a fundamental shift in the positions of the Arab countries, especially the Saudi-Egyptian-Jordanian axis, which seeks to strengthen its role in the balance of regional powers, and reject any attempts aimed at displacing the Palestinian people or imposing unilateral solutions.

Diab believes that this articulated stage must express an Arab consensus on the rejection of any plan to displace the Palestinians or impose an ""alternative homeland"" in any of the Arab countries, as this is a direct threat to national security for each country separately, and the Arab national security in general.

Diab notes that the statements of US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on this issue are an existential threat to the region, due to its repercussions on Arab national societies and the stability of existing political systems.

Diab notes that this development represents the beginning of the disintegration of the traditional strategic alliance between some Arab countries and the United States, as the Arab countries have begun to realize the importance of adopting a more independent foreign policy, by diversifying their international alliances and opening up to other forces such as China, Russia, and Iran, along with Reinforcement Cooperation with European countries to confront extremist American policies.

This shift is expected to lead to the emergence of new understandings between the Arab axis and two major axes in the region, namely Türkiye and Iran, with the aim of facing the common existential threats imposed by American and Israeli policies.

At the international level, Diab indicates that Trump's policies were not limited to the Middle East, but also extended to crises with many countries in the world, as these policies seek to destabilize economic, security and military stability globally, to undermining international institutions such as the United Nations and UNESCO, International Criminal Court.

Diab explains that Trump and Netanyahu are working to form a new global system based on extremist right -wing rule, seeking to impose a specific political and economic model on all countries.

Diab believes that the Arab position rejecting these plans intersects with the interests of many affected countries, which may open the door for new international alliances to confront these trends.

Diab emphasizes the importance of basic steps to confront the planning for the Palestinian displacement, to move immediately to block the road in front of these plans before it is too late.

It indicates The priority must be for the reunification of the Palestinian ranks by forming a temporary technocrat that includes all Palestinian factions, including the Palestinian Authority, the PLO, Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
Diab stresses the necessity of jointly reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, to ensure the stability of the internal situation and prevent any attempts to impose external solutions.

It calls for the crystallization of an Arab political project, and possibly wider Islamic, aimed at supporting the Palestinian issue at the international level, by pressuring international institutions and international legitimacy to recognize the rights of Palestinians and emphasize the two -state solution.

Diab indicates the need to work on building a broad international alliance that includes Arab countries, the Islamic world, the European Union, and Latin America, in addition to the countries affected by Trump's policies such as Canada and Mexico.

Diab confirms that international institutions, such as the United Nations and human rights organizations, can play a decisive role in this alliance to stop US-Israeli plans and restore balance to the international system.

Diab stresses that this moment represents a historical opportunity for the Arab world to rebuild its alliances and prove its role as a major actor In international politics, instead of being satisfied with the role of the recipient of decisions.

Diab confirms that these developments may lead to a fundamental change in the balance of global powers, which calls for new Arab strategies to face future challenges.

A different summit from its predecessors

The writer and political analyst Awni Al -Mishni considers that the Arab Summit at the end of this month will be different from its predecessor from the tops, explaining that the current threats facing Arab countries are not limited to the Palestinian people only, but also include clearly and explicitly the national interests of Arab countries, especially Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

Al -Mishni explains that the Israeli ambitions have become more clear, as Israeli and Israeli officials speak about their ambitions in Jordanian, Syrian, Lebanese, Iraqi and Egyptian lands, which reflects their intentions not only with aspirations, but also to seek to achieve them.

Al -Mishni stresses that the displacement of the Palestinians, which Israel promotes, is a direct threat to many Arab national interests, including Egyptian and Jordanian interests.

Al -Mishni says: ""The next Arab summit will be held in light of this great threat, and it will be at the level of this The danger, just as the summit will revolve around protecting the national interests of these countries, and not only solidarity with the Palestinian people, ""noting that the summit will present new positions related to these interests.

Al -Mishni notes that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia faces a difficult position after US President Donald Trump's endeavor to pressure Saudi Arabia to finance the displacement plans.

Al -Mishni says: ""Saudi Arabia today is in a position that cannot accept the continuation of normalization under these American and Israeli policies.""

Al -Mishni believes that ""the next Arab summit will be to send a message that the Arab countries will not be subject to American pressure, and that the Arab climate is now ready to accommodate these positions.""

Al -Mishni explains that the Arab regimes, despite their historical relations with the United States, will not be able to remain subject to American pressure.

Al -Mishni says: ""The upcoming summit language will be different from the previous summits; it will be more clear and less mysterious, and will reflect more practical positions, which will contribute to achieving the minimum demands of the Palestinian people.""

As for facing Zionist ambitions in Arab lands, Al -Mishni confirms that what is required of the Arab countries is A unified and clear position.

Al -Mishni says: ""Despite the weakness and fragmentation of the Arab situation, the Arab world has many capabilities that can stop these ambitions, such as oil, geographical location, international relations, and popular will.""

Al -Mishni stresses that the Palestinian people have held a 15 -month in the face of the Israeli occupation, and this reflects the ability of the Arab nation to confront if it unites and unites its positions.

Al -Mishni stresses that what is required is a unified Arab position that does not allow the Israeli occupation to infiltrate the Arab region without achieving a just peace.

Al -Mishni says: ""The Palestinians must be granted their basic rights, foremost of which is the establishment of their independent state and its capital, Al -Quds Al -Sharif, in the entire West Bank and Gaza Strip.""

Al -Mishni stresses that the next Arab summit must be a lever for the Arab position in the face of Zionist ambitions, pointing out that the Arab countries and Arab peoples possess a lot of capabilities to support the Palestinian issue and to stop the Israeli expansion in the region.

If the Arabs do not reject Trump's scheme, it will not be stability

The writer and political analyst Imad Moussa believes that the upcoming Arab summit carries an agenda An American aims to give legitimacy to the new Syrian authority, a step in line with what he described as ""renewable authorities"" that work for American interests in the region.

Moussa believes that there are American attempts to control Syrian gas and oil by controlling its marketing and prices, a step that seeks to exclude Russian gas and strangle the Chinese economy, in addition to forcing Iran to waive its nuclear program and support it for the ""Axis of Resistance"".

Moussa believes that the Arab summit operates according to this American agenda, especially after the Syrian government recently took measures indicating that it is going in this direction.

Moussa notes that this is part of the plans aimed at strengthening American hegemony in the region.

Moussa believes that the summit will also address the decision of US President Donald Trump to displace the people of Gaza to Jordan and Egypt, a definite decision aimed at controlling gas and oil resources in the region, which creates great tensions in Jordan and Egypt.

Moussa explains that the biggest challenge facing the official Arab regime and the Arab peoples is to stand unified against this dangerous American decision on the displacement of the people of Gaza, which threatens Palestinian rights means the displacement of part of the Palestinian people from its historical land.

Moussa warns that the Arab division in this file will destabilize the region, saying: ""If the unified Arab rejection of Trump's decision to deport is not achieved, then there will be no safety or stability in the region.""

Moussa calls for the summit to be a turning point in Arab positions towards the major challenges facing the Palestinian issue, warning of the consequences of the continued Arab indole in confronting American projects that threaten regional security.",PS
"The statements of US President Donald Trump about his endeavor to displace more than two million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, a permanent displacement to Egypt and Jordan, and the United States of America seizing the sector ""through long -term ownership"" to develop it real estate and convert it into ""Rvira Middle East"", in criticism and condemnation Wide Palestinian, Arab and international, as well as a categorical rejection from Egypt and Jordan. Trump had met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the White House on February 4, 2025, in his first meeting with a foreign country leader since he took office on January 20, 2025, where he made statements about the displacement of residents of the sector amid a welcome from Netanyahu.
The proposal developed
Although the Israeli desire to empty the Gaza Strip is one of its residents and their displacement of it dates back to decades, and has taken a more serious trend since the beginning of the war on Gaza on October 7, 2023, with Israeli officials talking about their intentions to make an ethnic cleansing in the Strip, Washington Under the administration of former President Joe Biden, he was officially opposed to forced displacement calls. The early emergence of the idea of ??""cleansing"" the sector of its residents in the department Surrounding Trump, in statements made by his son -in -law and the American policy official towards the Middle East during his first administration (2017-2021), Jared Kushner, on February 15, 2024, during a dialogue with him at Harvard University, when he said, ""The waterfront can be in Gaza is of great value. "" In the call, he did not express the explicit to bring the Palestinians to the Strip to the Negev and Egypt desert, then ""clean it."" Although he claimed that Israel had not explicitly talking about ""it does not want people to return there [the Strip] after that,"" he added, ""I am not sure that there are many Gaza that remained at this stage."" But the most dangerous in Kushner's comments, who had a great influence in Trump, was in his claim that Gaza was not historically populated, as it was ""the result of a war [...] there were tribes in different places and then Gaza became something.""
In October 2024, that is, when Trump was a candidate for the presidency, he said in a radio interview that the Gaza Strip could be ""one of the best places in the world, but the Palestinians failed to"" exploit ""his coastal location on the Mediterranean."" He added that Gaza ""may be better than Monaco ""because she enjoys"" the best site ""in the Middle East. He returned to putting the idea again shortly after his inauguration as president, describing the sector as"" a great location on the sea and has a beautiful weather [...] and some beautiful things can be done in it, "" He added that he may ""be ready to help in the reconstruction. The Jordanian monarch, King Abdullah II, can transfer more than a ""million and a half Palestinian"", either temporarily or long -term, to Jordan and Egypt to ""completely clean this place."" He categorically rejected them, as he continued to insist that they would eventually accept.

Trump, his son -in -law Kushner, and his envoy to the Middle East Stephen Witkeov, look at the Gaza Strip ""Real Estate Deal""
It is noteworthy here that both Trump, his son -in -law Kushner, and his envoy to the Middle East Stephen Witkeov, all of them work in the field of development. Real estate and business, they look at the Gaza Strip, a ""real estate deal"", they want to invest in it, not for a specific group of people (i.e. its people from the Palestinians), but for other customers; This is because its residents will never return to it, but will be resettled outside it.
Plan or just ideas?
Trump seems to surprise his statements about his desire to acquire and develop Gaza, senior officials in his administration, especially his statements he made at the press conference with Netanyahu, which is that his administration ""will do what is necessary"" to control and develop the Gaza Strip, as a limited number of his assistants The most prominent of them is the National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Wikkov, they were aware of what is planned To put him in his meeting with Netanyahu. The accounts are varied here regarding the Israeli side, a pre -flavored idea of ??the idea of ??Washington's acquisition of the Strip, as one of the sources says that Waltz and Wikkov discussed the idea with Netanyahu a day before his meeting with Trump, while other sources confirm that Netanyahu heard about it the first time of Trump shortly before it was announced in front of the journalists.
Although Trump was at the press conference with Netanyahu reading from a paper about his proposal, which means it is an official announcement Daughter and not an emotional attitude, White House officials stated that this proposal was not discussed in the departments of the administration concerned with Middle East affairs, nor did it discuss its feasibility and realism. Media reports indicate that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Defense did not surround a pre -knowledge of the perceptions and formation of work committees on the idea, and the Ministry of Defense did not provide any estimates of the numbers of the American forces required to control the sector, nor how to do so. Based on the foregoing, the idea appears to have evolved as a result of discussions between Trump and a few of his advisers, unlike the recognized development of major policies in the United States. Hence, it can be described as closer to ideas than being an integrated plan that has been thoughtful in a deliberate manner. This is confirmed by the chaos that the Trump administration prevailed after his statements during his meeting with Netanyahu, as US officials sought to alleviate its severity, especially as it represents a flagrant violation of international law, and is not based on a clear American legal ground that authorizes Trump to do so. White House spokesperson, Caroline Levat, announced on February 5 that Trump had not committed to sending American forces to a sector Gaza. While Defense Minister Beit Higseth said that the US government is ""very far"" from interfering in the sector, although Trump had confirmed that his administration ""would do what is necessary"" to achieve this. Levat confirmed that the exit of the Palestinians from Gaza will be ""temporary"", although Trump clearly said that he would be permanently, and stressed that the United States will not provide any money for reconstruction. As for the Foreign Minister, Marco Rubio, who indicates that he did not participate in the details of the proposal in advance, yet he expressed his support for him, he tried to reduce Trump's statements by saying that it is not a ""hostile step"", but rather a ""very generous"" plan on the part of the states United to help the reconstruction of Gaza. ""Many parts in Gaza, even if people return to them, they will not have a place to live safely, because there are unexploded, wreckage, and ruins.""
A number of statements were issued by Israeli right -wing ministers who support Trump's idea to purify the Gaza Strip ethnically.
A number of statements were issued by Israeli right -wing ministers who support Trump's idea to purify the Gaza Strip ethnically.
But Trump returned, on February 6, in another indication of the absence of a vision It is clear about this issue in its administration, to confirm that Israel will receive the Gaza Strip to the United States ""at the end of the fighting [...] and the resettlement of the Palestinians in more secure and more beautiful societies"", without clarifying its purpose from that, and if it means allowing Israel to resume the aggression The sector must displace its residents by military force, or by preventing humanitarian aid and reconstruction materials from entering it. Trump's hints are not compatible here, as he boasted that he was the one who managed to achieve the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, a day before he received the presidency. It was not one day before his last statement, until he returned to confirm that ""the United States will look at the matter [controlling Gaza] as a real estate deal [...] but there is no need to rush to do anything."" And with the succession of criticism against him that it appears in his presentation towards Gaza that he is a real estate developer more than he is the President The table [...] I think this will make the entire region come with its own solutions if it does not like the solutions of Mr. Trump. ""
It did not come These criticisms are from Arab and international parties only, nor from the Democratic Party alone, but even from the Republicans themselves who saw it as a release from Trump about his slogan that he guides in his foreign policy, ""America first"". They point out that his ambitions in controlling one of the worst disaster areas in the world contradict his criticism of his predecessors in involvement in endless wars, or his criticism of George Bush's attempt to rebuild Iraq after his occupation in 2003. His critics of the Republicans indicated that his intention to control over The Gaza Strip and its reconstruction, which will cost tens of billions of dollars, contradict its endeavor to close the US agency For international development (USAID) under the pretext that it spends billions of dollars on external aid annually.
The repercussions of the proposal
Trump's insistence on the plan to displace the population of the Gaza Strip will have great repercussions, especially since he also talks that his administration will adopt the possibility of recognizing that Israel will include large parts of the West Bank. Some circles in Washington fear that the mere proposed offering may lead to an increase in violence in the region, the sabotage of the ceasefire and the exchange of detainees between the resistance Palestinian and Israel, especially since Netanyahu is trying to evacuate in every possible way of implementing the second and third phases in the agreement in which Qatar, Egypt and the United States mediated. Indeed, a number of statements were issued by Israeli right -wing ministers supporting Trump's idea to purify the Gaza Strip ethnically, including the matter issued by the Israeli Minister of War, Israel Katz, on February 6, for the army to prepare a plan to allow the voluntary exit of the population from the Gaza Strip.
Although Netanyahu described Trump's proposal as ""the wonderful idea that must be examined, followed up and implemented [...] because it will create a different future for all, reinstine the Middle East and bring peace"", it is unclear if Israel really wanted to hand over the United States the ownership of Gaza and the concession What she really promises to her. It is more likely that Israel wants to employ Trump's ability to pressure the Arab countries to accept the idea of ??displacement of the Gaza Strip and contributing to its reconstruction, with international support, then enables it to control it within arrangements with Washington, and perhaps with guarantees of Trump companies and its partners. There is no doubt that Netanyahu left his meeting with Trump happy, at least in terms of wasting the latter The opportunity to click on him to adhere to the ceasefire agreement, which is credited with himself.
Idea
Idea
Some of them in Washington warn that Trump's insistence on this proposal may hinder his other endeavors to expand the circle of Abrahamic agreements, especially after Saudi Arabia announced a position rejecting any efforts to displace Palestinians from the Strip, and its assertion that it will not be printed with Israel without guarantees for the establishment of a Palestinian state, which is rejected by Netanyahu. completely. They say that the idea of ??the United States seizes Gaza turns the official American position, which has been adopted for decades, is the two -state solution upside down, and that it would push the United States to the heart of the ""Palestinian -Israeli"" conflict in a way that former presidents have tried since Harry Truman's era Avoid it. The pressures of Trump on Jordan and Egypt may lead to unrest in the two allies of America.
conclusion
See some Trump's advisers said that his proposal controlled the United States on the ""fictional"" Gaza Strip, and that he will fade over time after it becomes clear to him that he is not applicable, but this will be primarily dependent on the level of resistance that the proposal will face a Palestinian, Arab and international. Trump's opinions and policies are not a destiny if there is an official Palestinian and Arab position not only rejecting, but also provides a practical plan to confirm the Palestinian people on their land in the Gaza Strip, ensuring its reconstruction and supporting their steadfastness on their land. The response to the dangerous Trump provocative project begins by breaking the siege on the Gaza Strip from the Arab side, from the Egypt Gate, and providing assistance, relief and temporary housing for its residents without coordination or waiting for permission from those who practice extermination and plan to displace them, while the second step is pressure on the Palestinians to rebuild the Palestinian Liberation Organization. And the establishment of a body affiliated with the Palestinian Authority for the administration of Gaza, and the formation of an Arab or Arab -Islamic body that sets the reconstruction plans, The budgets needed to implement them are allocated to her, and at the same time urge the Palestinians to file compensation against Israel and support them in this endeavor. Only such a plan is marginalized by Trump's endeavor and Netanyahu, And put an end to their tampering with the fate of peoples in this region.",UK
"Perhaps it is that the summit that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia called for, on the twenty -first of this month, is a resignation of Abd al -Rahman al -Kawakibi, who had called in his book ""Umm Al -Qura"", in a general group, in order to put an end to what he called the public pride, and that the affairs of the Arabs return to the Arabs .
The summit that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia called for on February 21, and includes alongside the sponsoring state, Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, the Emirates, and the Palestinian Authority, it comes during it, for a clear and decisive position regarding Trump's plan to displace the Palestinians of Gaza, and to include the West Bank Western by Israel, which is an unannounced step, but it falls on what is planned.
The priority is to take a decisive position on the Trump plan on displacement, by diplomatic means, by reminding the international rules that contradict the forced displacement that is related, and the relevant international decisions on the status of Gaza and the West Bank, starting with Resolution 242, and the Oslo agreement, and its existing reference on the ground In exchange for peace, and the Arab initiative adopted by the Arab Summit in Beirut in 2002, and approved the two -state solution, with a reminder The role of the United States, since the 1991 Madrid conference, to be a mediator Emphasis, for a fair, permanent and comprehensive solution to the Arab -Israeli conflict, and the essence of the Palestinian issue.
The outputs of the Riyadh Summit will be a ground for the Cairo summit, and it is advisable to form a committee consisting of foreign ministers of these five countries, to present the requirements of the conference to the Secretary -General of the United Nations, and the permanent members of the Security Council and the European Union, and it may be added to both India and Brazil, just like It resulted in the Fez Summit in 1982, which adopted King Fahd's scheme, and a seven -year -old committee emerged from it, which presented the project content to the countries Permanent membership in the Security Council.
It is important to assign the results of the five -year summit with a unified position, by the Islamic Solidarity Organization, at the level of foreign ministers in the first stage. It is also important for the next summit to include a planning for the reconstruction of Gaza, with an international conference, which the United Nations sponsored in this regard, in which reconstruction is consistent with acknowledging the rights of the Palestinian people in determining their fate.
Other diplomatic papers remain in the maximum case, if the United States is exposed to the positions of Arab countries, and they have been ignoring them, namely waving the freezing of the Camp David agreement, and the Treaty of Wadi Araba, Abraham agreements. In all cases, work should be worked according to diplomatic tools, so it does not help to wave others, as the masses, military exercises, even the oil weapon, or boycott.
There is no need to recall that the scenario of displacement is a fuel for catastrophe, not at the level of the region or the Arab world, but at the level of international relations, by opening a terrible and huge separation of the clash of civilizations, the spread of violence, hatred, and lack of confidence.
It is hoped that the conference to be held in Riyadh will be an entrance to a new Arab system as well, and it has ended in practice since 1979. The circumstance is a way to establish a new Arab system, speaking with one tongue about fateful issues, or what was previously called the unity of the class and the purification of the atmosphere, and takes general rules to manage the difference , Or what was called the Erbaa Al -Sadha, and it is not necessary to use the same expressions that have become Foolishness, the language of data, nor the inferiority, but a pragmatic approach, which works according to diplomatic tools, and keeps the door of dialogue open.
However, a new Arab system requires new tools, it is not certain that the old tools, which were affected by the high and in the deficit, would respond to the existing challenges, in a clearer expression, Despite what this opinion might be from Jajaj, I do not see the League of Arab States, which appeared in a context dating back to the post -World War II, is the best framework to face the existing challenges, or to establish a new Arab system.
The Arab world has been distributed between regional powers, and this situation contributed to deepening the difference and weakening it. The circumstance is wiped, in front of these regional powers, in order to establish a new Arab system.
The Iranian role is weak, and its attractiveness was shaken, and it is no longer a origin. As for Israel, it may reveal that its goal is not peace, but surrender, by steering the Arab world, politically and culturally, in an ailateral situation, the final system of the Palestinian issue, and the transfer of Israel's responsibilities regarding the Palestinian people, and its contradictions to the role of neighborhood, but to the Arab world countries, The whole.
Besides, Saudi Arabia can be a sponsor of a new Arab system, which is helped by its Arab and Islamic weight, and its extension, and its balanced relations with China, Russia, India and the European Union, as well as its historical and firm relations with the United States.

"Attention should be paid out that a plan
Trump
Towards
Gaza
And its resistance is linked to two roofs or
Two levels:
The first: level
The highest talks about the acquisition of Gaza and the displacement of its people, and to find a tremendous pressure on the people of Gaza and on
Egypt and Jordan to deal realistically with it, accept what can be accepted and implement
Volunteer ""with the power of the de facto.
Second: level
A more seriously targeted mediator, and Trump and the Israeli occupation see it is possible to investigate
And more realistic, and he will find a positive resonance in the Arab environment, and with the authority of Ramallah. Which is
Achieving what the occupation failed in its declared goals from the crushing of Hamas and the disarmament of the resistance,
And its removal is not only from the management of the sector, but also from participation and its resistance current, from
Participation in institutions and civil life, as happened in the West Bank.
If the first level is not achieved, the ""waiver"" is done
For the second level, the matter appears as if the Arab countries achieved a ""victory"", while
Try to pill
Palestinians
""The bait"", by pushing them to respond to the level
the second!!
Scenarios:
Through the realistic reading of the Arab system, its political performance and its backgrounds, the second scenario appears to be more likely
In front of the Arab countries, especially Egypt and Jordan, three
Scenals in the face of Trump's plan, which aims to displace the Palestinians of the Gaza Strip:
1- The implicit or practical approval of the Trump plan, and the opening
The door for an operation
Displacement
, Under the pretext of ""temporary"" humanitarian treatment
The Israeli occupation of turning the Gaza Strip into a destroyed and unprecedented area, and its rejection
Allowing the introduction of building materials and reconstruction, as it continues to aggressively on the sector
In different degrees and convert it into an inappropriate environment and an repellent environment.
2- ""Rejection
The soft ""of Trump's plan, by continuing to close the border in the face of a process
Displacement, and the use of a quiet language to absorb and absorb Trump's impulsion and justify it gradually,
And avoid any direct contact with him; With the continuous emphasis that Trump's behavior threatens
Her supreme interests and national security and threatens to lose her allies in the region, which means
They implemented her loss of her interests in the region.
3- The decisive and strong rejection of Trump's plan, and the activation of popular environments
Official institutions against the plan, the use of a deterrent attacking language, and their absolute rejection of blackmail
Political and financial, and holding Trump and the Israeli occupation are responsible for dropping the path of settlement
Peaceful and two -state solution.
yet, The first scenario appears excluded, because that contradicts
With the national security of these countries, and because it may cause them political and popular problems, or reflects
On its social fabric as in Jordan. Also, the third scenario remains excluded, not
There is a desire and no possibility for political systems to confront and challenge Trump. Therefore, who
During the realistic reading of the Arab system, its political performance and its backgrounds, the scenario appears
The second in ""soft rejection"" is more likely.
* * *
Marketing of resistance weapons:
And because the Arab position will be rejecting the plan of displacement, it will be
It is popular as a national and national ""heroic"" position. And then he will resort
The Israeli occupation and the Americans to pressure Gaza through three papers: the first is the possibility
The resumption of the war on Gaza and the tragedies and suffering it carries; The second is the way to enter
Aid and preventing the reconstruction process, and the third continues the displacement process within the sector
And make it an uncleal area.
At that time, the idea of ??sending Arab and international forces will be marketed
For the sector, its administration with the participation of the Ramallah authority according to Israeli standards, and directed by Hamas
And the resistance movement from political and public life, and the removal of weapons Resistance ... as requirements
It is necessary to stop bloodshed, thwart the displacement project and the possibility of starting reconstruction. And it will be
Presenting this as a supreme interest, and Hamas will be pursued as a reason for disruption
These interests.
As for ""persuading"" the Israeli and American parties
With ""retreat"" for the idea of ??displacement, it will appear as a big concession, while it is
In fact, the Israeli occupation has completed its main declared goal of the war.
In this atmosphere,
While the Palestinian popular environment was refused by an overwhelming majority of Arab and foreign interference
In the administration of the Gaza Strip, where this idea did not support more than two or three percent, according to
Opinion polls during the war, nor did he support the idea of ??managing the Ramallah authority for the sector
Under the leadership of Mahmoud Abbas, more than 15 percent, according to the same polls, will become such a negative solution
For marketing, it is not necessarily as the best, but rather on the basis of the easiest of the two harm. As for Hamas
She had about 60 percent of support.
Facing the challenge:
The American will and the Israeli will are not a destiny, and both the Israeli occupation and the American administration suffer from major crises, and they are not in a situation that enables them to launch wars Wide, the nature of Trump itself tends to be bound and bargaining, but it does not tend to wars. And if the resistance was able to challenge and thwart the Israeli -American aggression and plans, it is first for the Arab countries that the Arab countries can thwart it if it decides to do so
You can deal with
This challenge according to the following data and general lines:
1- The management of a sector
Gaza is a Palestinian affair, and the Palestinians are concerned with developing appropriate perceptions and industry
Their decision in light of their national consensus. As for the Palestinian refugees in the Strip, they move them
The natural supported by international decisions is for their Palestinian land from which they were exited in 1948.
2- It is a weapon
The resistance is the one who has protected the Gaza Strip for five fierce wars launched by the occupation over the Strip, which is
A natural right for the Palestinian people to defend themselves and liberate their lands.
3- It is a weapon
The resistance was the one that failed the displacement, forced the occupation to withdraw from the Strip, and succeeded in a contract
An honorable deal for the exchange of prisoners, and therefore it was the first line of defense for the Arab nation
And the Islamic, and on the Arab and Islamic national security, and its survival and strengthening is a supreme interest;
The attempt to remove it opens the way for the Zionist eagerness to the Arab environment And careful in
Adaptation and weakening it.
4- It is not permissible
The reward for the occupation for its criminality, massacres and brutality, and it is not permissible to punish the resistance on
Its heroism, sacrifices and achievements. The response to the Israeli -American agenda is achieving
It has a policy that has not failed in the war, and puts the Arab countries that may correspond to this
The agenda, not only in the face of the free will of the Palestinian people and their options, but also
In the face of their people, which generally support the resistance line.
5- The first
In the Arab environment, the failure of displacement and adaptation plans, by emphasizing the will
Free for the Palestinian people, their right to land and liberate them, and by breaking the siege and allowing entry
Relief and reconstruction meters.
6- The will
The American and the Israeli will is not destiny, and both Israeli occupation and administration
The American suffer from major crises, and not in a situation that enables them to launch wide wars,
The nature of Trump itself tends to be bound and bargaining, but it does not tend to wars. And if it is
The resistance has managed to challenge and thwart the Israeli -Israeli aggression and plans,
The first section is that the Arab countries can thwart them if they decide, and used tools
Equivalent To achieve it.

Arab and Muslim Americans had a role in returning Donald Trump to the White House. Although their percentage is not great in the United States, their influence was great for two main reasons: the first is to focus them in some of the decisive states in which the competition intensified in the presidential elections such as Michigan, and the second is the size of the media influence that the issues that are related to Arabs and Muslims, the most prominent of them The Palestinian issue and its recent dramatic embodiment in the Gaza war.
The first issue was of course important for Trump in terms of electoral aspect, while the importance of the second issue continues with the start of his presidency. The Arab and Muslims were shocked as they listened to President Trump's ideas with the beginning of his presidency, in which he raised the issue of transferring Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and ""taking"" the United States to the Strip.
In the city of Derburn in Michigan, the population of the majority of Arab descent is a clear model of Trump's superiority, reaching Arab American voters, and obtaining their votes at the expense of his democratic competitor, Kamala Harris, former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden had received a percentage Two -thirds of the votes of Dearborn's voters excelled when he beat Trump in 2020, but things changed a lot after four years.
When I went with the BBC team to visit Derborn and other areas in Michigan while covering the election campaigns in 2024, the population of Arab origin was angry at the Biden-Harris administration, and they held it responsible for the Gaza war and its continuation. Among those was the brunette of Luqman, the activist of the Democratic Party of Biden, but decided to vote for Trump's Republican because she held Biden responsible for the Gaza war and not to stop Israel, as she put it.
On her day, she told me about its influence and pain due to the Gaza war, and she also told me about a direct meeting with Trump through his campaign that she contacted, despite her affiliation with the opposing party. Trump - as she said - was talking to her, and told her the need to stop the war, and this played a great role in making the decision to vote in his favor.
End proposed stories
Although Trump never hidden his support for Israel, not when he was president in his first presidency, nor during his campaign, his movement towards the Arab Americans was successful, as he focused on the idea of ??his promise to end the war in the Middle East, and to say It would not have erupted if he was president.
On the practical side, Trump visited Michigan repeatedly, and even went to Derborn herself, where Arab voters celebrated him, and interacted with his promises to end the war and the start of a new era, and in the end Harris paid a heavy political price when she only got 37 percent of the votes of Dearborn's voters, While Trump won 43 percent of their votes, voices went Others to other candidates.
Brunette now told us and asked her if she was regretful to vote for Trump, and she said that she received many questions that come in the form: ""Are you happy now after Trump began calling for an ethnic cleansing in Gaza?"" Gaza during the war, and the names that can be called.
Samra says that she fully believes that Biden would not have stopped the war, while Trump was able to stop it, and that the scenes of the returnees from the people of Gaza to their homes despite the difficult circumstances, would not have spoken if the Biden -Harris administration was in power.
Samra goes to explain her position by saying that she is not happy with Trump's statements about Gaza, but when it is compared to what could have happened and continue without his arrest of the war, This is something that makes it satisfied, or at least in a better condition than it was during the war.

As for Bishara, with a chair of an organization whose name was (Americans for Trump), the nature of its activities is clear from the name, which is the electoral and political crowd of Trump, but the organization decided to change its name to become (Americans for peace).
Bhahbah explains that the name change came with Trump's statements regarding the transfer of the Palestinians from Gaza to outside it, and the seizure of the Strip, but he says that the reason for the direct change is that a new stage has started in the relationship of his organization and the relationship of Arab Americans with Trump, which is that he has become a president. And that the presidential elections have been resolved.
Trump's ideas shocked many of his political opponents in the United States, so they criticized them. For example, the Senator Tim Kain, who represents the state of Virginia, which includes many Arab voters and Muslims, and he is a leaders of the Democratic Party of Biden, as Trump's ideas described ""crazy"". As for the only American deputy with Palestinian origin, Rachida Talab from Michigan, she was severely borne on Trump and his statements.
I called Tibet Her colleagues in Congress who support the two -state solution to move, but the criticism of Trump does not mean that the American support for Israel has weakened. The expense of Tibet, a progressive democratic deputy Alexandria Okazio Cortez, has recognized that support for Israel is still great in both Republican and Democratic parties, and that the issue raises a division in the United States, at the level of different generations, as many young people tend to oppose Israel's policies and American support Her, compared to those who are older.
Criticism of Trump's ideas was not limited to his opponents, some of his allies also expressed their deep doubts about it, such as Senator Lindsay Graham, who is usually supportive to use military force as a means of influence, but he reserved the idea of ??sending American soldiers to Gaza.
However, Trump governs control of his Republican party because of his great victory in the elections, which made it difficult for the opposition votes among his allies to rise. However, Trump returned to retract only the part of the sending of forces to Gaza with his insistence on the idea of ??controlling Gaza, and its reconstruction after the Palestinians were removed from it.
Trump supporters say in Congress and in His administration, the ideas that he put forward are strong, courageous and new in a region, and have not witnessed change or progress, but rather a return to ideas, statements and policies themselves for decades.
In Dearburn, Michigan and regions that the American Arabs concentrate, many of them question the possibility that Trump's ideas on Gaza will turn into a practical reality, and many of them say that his election as a president stopped the war at least, and opened the way to hope for more of the influence of Arabs on his future policies.
Bechara Bhahbah says that he wants to remind Trump that there are upcoming elections for Congress, as Trump's Republican Party owns a small majority in the two chambers, the House of Representatives and the Senate.
The elections will take place at the end of next year, and explains with Habhah: ""Trump will need our votes in order to keep his party's control over the congressional councils, we are here and we have not yet finished.""",UK

Raed Al -Dubai: The meeting of Sheikh Boykov indicates that Washington is not reservations about dealing with the PLO and power despite the blurring of the American track.


The region is witnessing extensive diplomatic moves in the context of the American administration's attempts to revive what is known as the ""deal of the century"" or the payment of the ""Abraham Conventions"" of their two new versions, amid questions about the success of these efforts in achieving a diplomatic breakthrough in the level of Arab-Israeli normalization, to try to employ the issue Palestinian in favor of achieving these agreements.

A book, political analysts, specialists, and university professors believe in separate conversations with ""?"" that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stands out as a pivotal element in these endeavors, as Washington is trying to persuade it to conclude a normalization agreement with Israel, in exchange for providing promises related to With the Palestinian issue, however, the Saudi official position is still adhering to the necessity of a ""clear path"" to establish a Palestinian state.

The writers, analysts, specialists, and university professors believe that while pressure on the Palestinian Authority is increasing to engage in these efforts, the Palestinian leadership has challenges to reject any economic solutions that are presented as an alternative to a political solution to the Palestinian issue, amid concerns about the scenario of the ""Gaza State"".

Displacement scenarios are rejected and proved their field failure

The professor of diplomacy and conflict solution at the Arab American League, Dr. Dalal Erekat, confirms that attempts to displace Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Egypt and Jordan have not succeeded since the beginning of the war and will not succeed in the future, stressing that these scenarios are not only rejected, but have proven their failure in the field.

Erekat believes that the proposals put forward by the Donald Trump administration in this context were ""test balloons"", but they did not find acceptance from the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which categorically rejected any project aimed at emptying the Gaza Strip from its residents.

Erekat notes that although there are about 1.9 million Palestinians in the southern Gaza Strip regions, Especially in Al -Mawasal and on the border with Rafah during the first months of the war, the Egyptian border was not opened to the forced displacement scenario, but on the contrary, Egypt sought to preserve the steadfastness of the Palestinians in their lands in the service of the Palestinian cause.
In the context of talking about the recent diplomatic moves of the United States of America, Erekat considers that it comes within the framework of the ""second season"" of what is known as the ""deal of the century"", or what can be called ""renewed Abraham agreements"", through which the American administration aims to complete a normalization agreement Between Saudi Arabia and Israel.

Erekat explains that Saudi Arabia has so far preserved its position in support of Palestinian rights, especially with regard to the establishment of a Palestinian state, but Erekat warns of changes in political discourse, noting that the language used recently is focusing on a ""road plan to establish a Palestinian state"" instead of immediate demand to establish The state as a pre -normalization condition.

Erekat notes that this change may carry political connotations that need an accurate reading from the Palestinian side, especially since any future agreement may be subject to transformations in priorities and demands.

In this context, Erekat stresses the importance The Palestinian role in these moves, stressing that the Palestinian issue cannot be reduced in economic or security dimensions, but rather a political issue must remain in its essence.

""I hope that Palestinian officials who meet American or Arab officials express the real Palestinian position, based on rooted political rights, not only economic rights or improving living conditions,"" said Erekat.

Erekat stresses that any political path discussed with the American or regional side must first focus on ending the Israeli military occupation, defining the borders of the State of Israel, and emphasizing the concept of Palestinian sovereignty, stressing that security and stability in the region will not be achieved without a fair and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian issue.

Warning about the seriousness of the ""Gaza State"" scenario

As for talking about the scenario of the residence of the ""Gaza State"", Erekat warns of the danger of this proposal, noting that ""it must be fully rejected"", because it contradicts the unity of the Palestinian land, which includes the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Jerusalem.
And it confirms that any attempts to separate Gaza from the West Bank threaten the Palestinian national project and serve the Israeli vision aimed at undermining a solution The two countries.

Erekat expresses her concerns about attempts to weaken the West Bank by strengthening the economic situation separately from political solutions, explaining that there is a tendency to pump more money into the Palestinian National Authority institutions under addresses such as supporting civil society or improving economic conditions, which may reproduce previous scenarios did not A real political progress has been achieved during the past decades.

She hopes that the Palestinian position will be clear in rejecting any economic solutions that are presented as an alternative to a political solution.
Erekat says: ""The Palestinian issue is not only a humanitarian file, despite the priority that must be granted to humanitarian aid, but rather a political issue with distinction, and no economic initiatives can compensate for Palestinian national rights.""

It stresses the importance of adopting a firm Palestinian national position in any future negotiations, so that the discussion is not reduced to issues such as clearing funds or salaries, but rather focuses on achieving the legitimate political rights of the Palestinians as an integral part of any future agreement, and that ""any solution does not guarantee justice for the Palestinians will remain Temporarily and vulnerable to collapse. ”

The genocide is continuing by other means

Dr. Hassan Ayoub, Professor of Science Politics at An -Najah National University and specializing in American affairs, that the Arab position rejecting what is going on in the Gaza Strip is a ""classic"" position since the beginning of the Israeli aggression, explaining that the main Israeli goal is still the displacement of the residents of Gaza, and that the post -armistice is still in place, Pointing out that ""the extermination continues by other means,"" noting that this context must be the framework through which it understands repeated American statements about the future The sector.

Ayoub believes that the Arab regimes suffer from ""fragility and weakness in front of American hegemony"", especially after the Arab Spring revolutions and the political changes that followed in the region.

Ayoub notes that the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria and the open possibilities for change in the region prompted these regimes to adhere more to their alliance with the United States, in an effort to financially, political and diplomatic support.

Ayoub notes that the current Arab position ""has not yet raised to the level of actual confrontation of Washington's positions"", but is still within the framework of statements and formal situations.

On recent political developments, Ayoub highlights the meeting that brought together the Secretary of the Executive Committee The Palestine Liberation Organization, Hussein Al-Sheikh, at the envoy of US President Steve Wittouf in Riyadh, indicating that this meeting coincides with frequent statements from the new Israeli ambassador in Washington, and the contact of the new American President with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, all of which are in the direction of reviving the Arab normalization path- Israeli.

He asks: ""What is the meaning of justifying the continued normalization of the presence of a reliable path - according to the American and Saudi expression - towards a Palestinian state? This is just words that have no actual balance, and the countries are either to rise or do The legitimate rights of the Palestinian people can be achieved, whether in establishing an independent state or in self -determination and salvation from the occupation.

Ayoub notes that the American administration may try to push this direction, although it will be much less than the understandings that were presented in the ""deal of the century"", explaining that this scenario requires a ""ethnic cleansing process in the Gaza Strip"", where the demographic issue remains ""the cornerstone"". In the conflict.

On the Jordanian position, Ayoub explains that the Kingdom of Jordan paid a ""high price"" during Donald Trump's first presidency, due to its lack of enthusiasm for the normalization agreements, as she did not participate in the signing ceremony of the ""Ibrahim Conventions"", which prompted the Trump administration to ignore Jordan and exert economic pressure on it, including reducing American aid to it.

Ayoub notes that today there are Jordanian voices saying that the Kingdom ""will not return to pay this price again"", and therefore it has not shown an objection to the continued normalization agreements, as long as this guarantees its continued relationship with the new American administration.

Ayoub confirms that Jordan, like Egypt, suffers from economic crises and increasing pressure, which may make it more inclined to make concessions in order to maintain its internal stability and the continued American support.

Ayoub explains that the Arab leaders have not yet realized that Washington is ""ready to gamble to the stability of their countries and their political systems if this is in the interest of Israel or serves the Zionist Christian agenda in America, who adopt a biblical vision of the conflict.""

Ayoub notes that the talk currently circulating about a ""mini -Palestinian state"" is something that was not officially proposed, explaining that the talk about the establishment of a ""miniature state in Gaza"" extends to the West Bank is An old idea that was presented since the era that accompanied the establishment of the Palestinian Authority led by the late President Yasser Arafat, but that was completely rejected, because it means devoting ""a temporary state in Gaza forever.""

Ayoub notes that the current scenario is ""worse than that"", as there is no longer any idea of ??a Palestinian state in Gaza or the West Bank, because Israel and the United States ""do not want any political entity for the Palestinians"", but rather focus on ""fighting the Palestinian national identity and removing Any opportunity for the Palestinians to remain adhering to their legitimate rights.

Ayoub says: ""In light of these data, the continuation of talking about a Palestinian state, a two -state solution, or the normalization of normalization with a political path is merely an ash in the eyes, as there is no serious project on the table that achieves Palestinian rights, on top of which is the end of the occupation.""


The Trump administration is heading towards a new version of the ""Deal of the Century""

The director of the Jerusalem Center for Political Studies, Arab Al -Rantawi, believes that the administration of US President Donald Trump has not yet been completed by a clear vision of the so -called ""comprehensive deal"" for the Middle East, but it has set its basic features, foremost of which is the stabilization of the path of normalization between Israel and Arab countries, in particular Saudi Arabia.

Al -Rantawi explains that Riyadh requires progress in the Palestinian track as part of this deal, to ensure the marketing of any normalization steps in front of Saudi and Arab public opinion, while preserving its regional and international position, especially with the growing role in the Syrian and Lebanese arenas.

Al -Rantawi indicates that the ongoing consultations led by the American envoy Steve Witkev aim to explore the possible and unable to the Palestinian file, explaining that his visit to Saudi Arabia, in addition to the shuttle meetings between Cairo and Doha play a decisive role in shaping the American vision of the next deal.

He notes that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's expected visit to Washington will contribute to the development of the final perception of this plan.

Al -Rantawi confirms that the Trump administration does not seek an ambitious project to resolve the conflict, but rather is heading towards a new version of the ""deal of the century"", which is more generous for the benefit of Israel.

Al -Rantawi explains that the series of steps that Trump has taken since he took office shows his full bias to the Israeli extremist right, as he sees that his team in the White House shares with his counterpart in ""Al -Karaa"" (the headquarters of the Israeli Ministry of War) visions and perceptions themselves About the conflict.

Al -Rantawi notes that Trump has adopted from his first day of his tasks policies in identifying with the Israeli extremist offering, including raising settlers from US sanctions lists, resuming supplying Israel with heavy bombs, and excluding them from the decision to freeze foreign aid, considering that these steps indicate the American administration's direction towards escalation Instead of political solutions.

Al -Rantawi notes that Trump looks at Gaza as a major axis in this deal, but he does not seek to create a ""emirate"" there, but rather a solution that is appropriate to what the American administration calls ""the next day's questions.""

It is believed that the Trump plan is based on an attempt to empty Gaza from its residents, in light of the escalation of talking about major investment projects led by the United States and Israel in cooperation with Gulf countries, targeting the region after the displacement of a large part of its residents, and only to keep those who need them as cheap workers to serve these projects.

On the Arab position, Al -Rantawi indicates that Trump seems confident of the response of the Arab countries with his vision towards the displacement of the people of Gaza, which raises the question about the source of this confidence.

Al -Rantawi notes that the issue is no longer only related to With the traditional support of the Palestinian issue, it extends to the effects of this deal on security and stability in Egypt and Jordan, as well as the risks that threaten the national and political identity of the two countries.

Al -Rantawi stresses that any Arab acceptance of the displacement and settlements projects offered will be greatly harmful to the interests of the countries concerned, noting that Jordan, for example, went through earlier stages with a suffocating blockade during the second Gulf War, but he managed to overcome it without making strategic concessions.

Al -Rantawi stresses that the Arab countries should not be subject to the logic of barter, as there are sovereign issues and relate to national and national identity that cannot be linked to financial deals or economic aid.

It warns that any Arab retreat will lead to the transfer of the conflict from its Palestinian-Israeli framework to internal conflicts in every Arab country separately, which Washington and Tel Aviv seeks.

On the Palestinian internal level, Al -Rantawi confirms that the failure to build a national consensus on the government of a Palestinian unity or a university leadership reference within the framework of the PLO led to the remaining Egyptian ""Societal Support"" initiative as a single option.

Al -Rantawi notes that this initiative, despite Its emphasis on the West Bank and Gaza unit, will actually dedicate actual separation, as each of them will be managed separately.

Al -Rantawi confirms that Trump and Kushner look at Gaza as a real estate project, and not as an independent political entity, as they seek to implement huge economic projects in the region in cooperation with Israel and Gulf countries, with a focus on the displacement of a large number of residents of the sector, and to keep those who can be employed in these projects.

In spite of the challenges facing the Palestinians, Al -Rantawi confirms that Gaza and the Palestinian resistance proved their adherence to the unity of the Palestinian land and the Palestinian people, noting that the waves of collective displacement witnessed in the Strip recently were a popular referendum to refuse to displace and separate from the West Bank.

Al -Rantawi believes that the war on the Gaza Strip has not ended yet, as the resistance managed to manage the military battle efficiently, despite the grave losses, but the political battle is still continuing, and it requires popular support and strong Palestinian leadership capable of facing challenges.

Al -Rantawi confirms that the priority now should be to rebuild the PLO and restore its leadership role, through radical reforms in The institutional structure, to enable the Palestinian leadership to deal effectively with the upcoming strategic challenges, stressing that the stage requires a real Palestinian agreement, and not just formal understandings.


The Sheikh's meeting- Witakouf .. political connotations

Raed Al -Dubai, Head of the Department of Political Science at An -Najah National University, believes that the choice of Riyadh to host the meeting that brought together the American envoy Steve Wittouf with the secretary of the Executive Committee of the PLO Hussein Al -Sheikh holds clear political connotations, as it reflects an American desire to give Saudi Arabia a growing leadership role in the region, Especially in light of its potential involvement in the American -based American project with Israel.

Al -Dabi explains that holding this meeting itself indicates that the United States does not reserve the dealing with the PLO and the National Authority, although the American path towards the Palestinian Authority is still blurry.

""At the time of US President Donald Trump declares his refusal to return Hamas to the Gaza Strip administration, reports indicate that Witkeov met a minister from the Hamas leadership with Qatari mediation, which reflects a new American trend based on interests Live more than it is based on comprehensive political solutions. ""

Al -Dambi notes that Ramallah's absence from the Wittakov visit agenda, which started today, in exchange for his visit to Gaza and his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and his previous visit to the ""Auschwitz"" camp in Poland, where he met the families of Israeli detainees in Hamas, reflects the priority of the security file In American policy, especially with regard to the release of Israeli prisoners, without a clear vision of a solution The two countries.

Al -Dabi stresses that ""this approach indicates a shift in the American priorities, as it seems that Washington is focusing on urgent security issues instead of offering major political initiatives,"" noting that the American proposals nominated to resolve the Palestinian -Israeli conflict appear to be disastrous and cannot be accepted Palestinian.

Al -Dabi explains that the Arab position faces increasing pressure, especially after Trump invited Egypt and Jordan to receive the residents of the Gaza Strip, in a move that would put the two countries in front of major political and security challenges.

Al -Dabai says: ""Accepting this step may mean holding Egypt and Jordan responsible for Gaza on behalf of Israel, which holds serious repercussions for their stability. Internal.

Al -Dambi indicates that these pressures come in the context of the American administration's use of financial and political extortion to impose its vision on the region, which increases the difficulty of preserving a unified Arab position towards the Palestinian issue.

Al -Dubai believes that regional transformations, Palestinian division and the results of the recent war on Gaza made the Palestinian National Authority and Hamas in a weak negotiating position.

""The Palestinian division can no longer manage the same previous mechanisms. The American administration seeks to reshape the positions of power in the Middle East through extensive political and economic pressure, and do not hesitate to use the threat of economic sanctions, which reduces the Palestinian options in the face of this new reality.""

Al -Dabi stresses that talking about the establishment of a Palestinian state has become closer to imagination, given the political reality based on the Israeli and American levels.

""The Israeli government led by Benjamin Netanyahu includes extremist right -wing components that do not believe in a two -state solution, and seeks to perpetuate the occupation and promote settlement, which makes any proposal to establish an unrealistic Palestinian state.""

Al -Dabi explains that formation The current American administration reflects an unimportant trend to establish an independent Palestinian state. Rather, it seems that the American policy is heading towards resolving the conflict, according to the Israeli vision based on ensuring a Jewish majority and reducing the number of Arabs in areas under Israeli control.

Al -Dabi notes that one of the indications indicating this approach is that the US Defense Minister Beit Higseth had previously stormed the Al -Aqsa Mosque with a group of extremist settlers, in a move that reflects its support for the hard -line right -wing positions that are in line with the Israeli vision based on Judaization and enhancing control over the Palestinian territories.

He points out that the positions of the new American ambassador to Israel and the Foreign Minister also reflect this trend, which confirms that the conflict management is going according to a purely Israeli agenda.

Al -Dabi asserts that Israel does not in any way seek to establish a Palestinian state, whether in the West Bank or Gaza, but rather works to perpetuate the Palestinian division and strike any ingredients for national unity.

""The Israeli strategy is based on keeping the Palestinians in a state of geographical and political division between the West Bank and Gaza, where the authority is kept The Palestinian is under continuous economic and security pressures, while work is underway to resolve the future of the Gaza Strip with arrangements that ensure that the Palestinian political system is not unified.

He notes that Israel may support proposals such as the formation of an administrative committee or any other scenario that guarantees the continuation of the division, even if it was through the return of Hamas to the rule of Gaza as part of understandings with the new American administration.

Al -Dabi explains that this policy aims to weaken any possibility of the emergence of a unified Palestinian leadership capable of imposing negotiating conditions or forming a coherent political entity.

Al -Dabi believes that ""the most likely scenario in the near future is not the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, but rather to strengthen the reality of the separation between Gaza and the West Bank, in a way that enshrines the Palestinian division, and gives Israel more time to consolidate its control over the Palestinian territories",PS
"As the title of my article was last week .. ""The World and Four years of trouble"", we come to the Arabs of President Trump's troubles, which he summarized in ""Rvira Middle East"", and by that, the afflicted Gaza and its homeless people who want to displace it to Egypt and Jordan. It was briefed by a crazy, impractical idea aimed at changing the form of the Arab -Israeli conflict and forgetting the issue of the Palestinian people, which still suffers the injustice of the ""American veto"" in the Security Council for more than seventy years, and reflects the idea of ??""the Riviera"" as well as the political confusion that the American administration is going through and trying to obscure the history Conflict and struggle in the region, the upperness of the Zionist Jewish history, and the perpetuation of the Holkost massacres in graves near the US embassy in Berlin and support Their goals that started with the promise of Balford 1917. The first meeting of the Arab leaders between the Jordanian monarch and Trump on the impact of President Trump's statements, which sparked controversy and met with a wide Arab and international condemnation and condemnation, regarding the seizure of the Gaza Strip and the establishment of a tourism project and the displacement of the Palestinian people from it. Since last January, he promotes Trump for the plan to displace the Palestinians of Gaza into neighboring countries, such as Jordan and Egypt, which he rejected Countries, Other Arab countries and regional and international organizations joined them. The US administration was not satisfied with supporting Israel in committing war crimes since October 7 that led to genocide in Gaza and left about 160 thousand dead and wounded by Palestinian innocent people, most of them children and women, and more than 14 thousand missing. What is the Arab position? What is the position of the two countries concerned .. Egypt and Jordan ?? According to what was reported by the news to visit the first Arab president to Trump in the White House .. Trump's assertion of the implementation of his tourism project, which he announced that he would invest in person, as for the Jordanian monarch, he had to confront the event with his diplomacy in the heart of the American political cuisine, so his answers to the press were American and international at the White House last Tuesday to discuss President Trump's proposal to control Gaza as follows: 1- They will come to America to respond to Trump's plan on Gaza, ""expressing his belief in"" the existence of a way to bring peace and prosperity in the region. "" This is the unified Arab position. ” He added that everyone should be a return The reconstruction of Gaza without the displacement of its people, and dealing with the difficult humanitarian situation in the Strip. The Jordanian position reminds us of its role and sacrifices in the Arab -Israeli conflict. He entered the 1967 war and fought the battle of dignity Which was an armed military clash that occurred on March 21, 1968 in the Jordanian town of Al -Karama on the Jordanian -western border, when the Israeli army tried to seize the Jordan River as a strategic target, as well as signing a peace -to -peace agreement. In front of the expected Arab rejection after the emergency Arab summit in Cairo on 27 February, which will take into account the Arab -American relations and the importance of their continuation and strengthening them for the common interests of both parties, the leaders may reach The Arabs to the formation of a ""higher Arab committee"" from a number of leaders of Arab countries whose mission is to meet President Trump in the White House to explain the Arab position and present the ideas that the Arabs have to end the Arab -Israeli conflict And the establishment of the Palestinian state based on the two -state solution. Because it is not applicable, especially since the US administration has not conducted a full political study to examine its usefulness. As for the American ambassador to Israel, ""Dan Shapirua"", he stated that Trump is not serious and that his proposal may lead to more extremism, as it may expose the hostages to release more danger. While US Defense Minister Beit Higst was more clear, President Trump is ready to listen To new and dynamic methods for the solution and ready to study all options, especially after sharp criticism from Arab and university countries Arabic. If President Trump continues to insist, it is an order - as he believed - outside the traditions of politics between countries, and a separation from the chapters of cheap political blackmail that aims to subject the Arab countries and adapt them to acceptance of the rejected and detailed century deal, but Jordan and Egypt have important means to confront the procedures The American - if you have to use it - it will have very negative repercussions on bilateral relations between the relevant parties, especially on Israeli security, which will have several options: 1- Freezing the Wadi Araba peace agreement between Jordan and Israel in 1994, and stopping security and military cooperation with the United States. 2. - Freezing or canceling the Camp David Peace Agreement between Egypt and Israel signed in 1979, which will undoubtedly follow the movement of the Egyptian army to the border Egyptian-Israeli and stop crossing the Israeli ships of the Suez Canal.",BH
"Today, in the British capital, London, nearly two hundred thousand protesters went out in support of the Palestinian people, and rejected the calls of President Princeton, Trump, the seizure of the Gaza Strip and the displacement of the Palestinians. The demonstration started in front of the British government headquarters, roamed the streets of London and concluded in front of the American embassy. This demonstration comes at the invitation of the movements of solidarity with the Palestinian people in the United Kingdom after the ceasefire agreement to confirm the continued support of the Palestinian people in light of the escalation of the Israeli occupation their aggression on the West Bank.
The demonstrators raised banners saying ""Gaza is not for sale"", and others say ""Gaza for the Palestinians"", while many demonstrators chanted ""Donald Trump, your plan will fail."" In an interview with the activist in the ""health field workers for Palestine"" movement, Dofuchi Savage, he told Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed: “We are here to demonstrate against our government’s policy in supporting Israel. It is something that our government did not respect. We are here because two hundred thousand Palestinians were killed and twenty thousand children were wounded Providing Israel with weapons. ""

It is a war criminal like ( Israeli occupation Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu, and every Friday we demonstrate in front of her house to demand expelling her We always participate in the national demonstrations in London for Gaza.
At the conclusion of the demonstration, a number of politicians and activists spoke from the rhetorical platform against the American embassy. Independent MP Jeremy Corbyn said: “We remember 22 years ago our demonstrations in 2003 against the war on Iraq. We are here to confirm that we have the right to be in the streets of London and everywhere to demonstrate and reject attempts to prevent and restrict. "". He added: ""The whole world has to reject the Trump plan. The people will not be deserted from Gaza. There is no power in the world that can impose ethnic cleansing on the Palestinians.""
""The International Court of Justice said that the case is not only targeting civilians in Gaza, but the whole occupation. Our mission is at the time In which the Palestinians return to their destroyed homes and search for corpses at the same time, will build Gaza and the next generation will live freely in their homeland, and we will forever be friends of the Palestinian people.
For her part, the deputy, Zara Sultana, said, ""This is not a conflict, but rather a system of destruction, displacement and demolition, and what we see now in the West Bank reflects this. Ethnic cleansing of a Palestinian two million in Gaza is a shame for the world and shame for the United States, Britain and Germany to support them genocide."" She stressed that ""the Palestinian people resisted the occupation for decades, which is a continuous struggle that cannot be broken until liberation. The shame of politicians in our country who colluded with the occupation. We will not stop demonstrating or silence until Palestine is liberated and the occupation ends and every Palestinian is free.""

Faris Amer, who spoke in the name of the Palestinian Forum in Britain, said that ""Gaza is not Trump and not to Netanyahu. Every Palestinian plot is for the Palestinians. The United States is an empire built on genocide and not a neutral party."" He pointed out that ""peace will not be achieved until peace is achieved for the Palestinian people and the end of the occupation. Hence, we ask where is the authority Palestinian what is going on? The authority led by Mahmoud Abbas continues to coordinate security with the occupation. If you want to represent the Palestinian people, you should end the division and coordination with the occupation.

In administration Strategy and Crisis Management, Dr. Murad Ali: ""I personally not
Optimistic about the summit, for several reasons, the first of which is: what history says, ""explaining that
“The previous events did not witness from the Arab countries or governments to take any steps
To be fair to the people of Gaza and stop genocide.
And in his speech
To ""Arabi 21"", he added: ""And even today they are unable to enter the tents
Not humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza, nor are you able to implement a ceasefire agreement
The fire, ""asking:"" On what is the basis if we expect them to be after what they made
Treating all these years and during the 15 months of the bloody extermination war, that it suddenly is fair
The Palestinian summit and the people of Gaza are in the face of the occupied entity? ""
Second, he pointed out that
""What has been leaked so far about what the Egyptian plan is that there will be a plan
Reconstruction under the supervision of a Palestinian committee and put several lines under the word of a committee, because this is what he said
Yesterday, Netanyahu, in his statement, had pledged that Hamas would be excluded from Gaza, and there will be no
The existence of the Palestinian Authority, and therefore it seems that the Egyptian plan is also compatible, with goals and promises
Trump for his voters. ""
And thirdly, Ali emphasized that he
He rejects this plan because ""its primary goal is to exclude the resistance and hand over its weapons, Tear
Gaza's teeth so as not to cause any headache for the occupier, and it will become another model of the West Bank that
The settlers praise it and the occupation praises it, storming it at any time, and prevents the transfer of funds
Aid to the families of the prisoners and detainees.
And he is ""in the end
The West Bank is governed by Palestinian names; This wants to repeat this in Gaza, and unfortunately what has been leaked
About the Egyptian plan is similar to this, ""asking:"" If there are guarantees that have been said about that
The plan, will these guarantees be achieved?, And if it is in the agreed ceasefire
From several weeks, he was between him to enter specific assistance and enter caravans and not applied,
What makes us make sure that they will adhere to the Egyptian plan? ""
And he concluded to say: ""What
It makes us pessimistic is the successive statements of the Secretary -General of the Arab League, Ahmed Abu Al -Gheit
His assistant Hossam Zaki, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdel -Ati, and the statements of those close to
The Emirati authorities, and the hesitating king of Jordan, who did not face Trump strongly in
Their press conference in Washington last week. ""
The Egyptian expert believes
That ""all these statements that talk about the lack of enthusiasm and demand them to move away and demand
The factions by step all indicate that There is an Arab compatibility with the Trump administration and management
Netanyahu to implement a specific plan, which makes us pessimistic and do not expect the best. ""
He concluded his speech by saying:
“Arab summits were held for Gaza, so what were the outputs of those summits? Did you offer anything?
I remember a summit in November 2023, a second summit a year later, then nothing,
So why this time we expect something different? And why do we optimistic? Then why postpone this
The summit in this way? How do we keep silent and do not take decisive positions yet? """,QA

With the progress of the hostage and prisoners ’exchange between Hamas and Israel, and in the midst of discussions and comments about its details, talk about the fate of the body of the former Hamas movement, Yahya Al -Sinwar.
The Saudi ""Al -Arabiya"" channel had quoted ""sources close to the progress of the negotiating process"" that Hamas sought to negotiate the body of Al -Sinwar to obtain it in the initial stage of the agreement. According to Israeli media published, Hamas's endeavor was met with ""a cut -off rejection"", knowing that Israel and Hamas have not yet officially commented on this issue.
What is expected regarding the possibility of restoring the Sinwar body by Hamas? Is it possible that this will be achieved in the near or far future, or is it not verified?
Yahya Ibrahim Hassan Al -Sinwar led Hamas after moving between several roles inside it.
He was arrested several times and was a former inmate in Israel's prisons for more than 20 years, then he was one of more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners who were released in a deal with the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011.
End proposed stories
After leaving the prison, the Sinwar took over multiple responsibilities in the Hamas devices gradually, until he was elected The commander of the movement in Gaza in 2017, then renewed his term for a second period in 2021. In August 2024, he became head of its political office days after the assassination of his predecessor Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran during the war in Gaza.
Israel says Sinwar is the owner of the decision to launch the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023 on Israel.

It is worth the end
Hamas attack killed about 1,200 people in Israel, according to official data and kidnapping 251 hostages, before Israel launched a war in Gaza that lasted for more than a year and caused the deaths of more than 48,000, according to the Hamas Ministry of Health.
After the attack of October 7, his name was included with Muhammad Al -Dhaif and Marwan Issa, Commander -in -Chief of the Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas and his deputy, on the list of ""international terrorists"" by the European Union. Before that date, the United States and Israel had put it in the wanted circle.
The Gaza war witnessed the killing of prominent leaders, describing ""engineers of the Al -Aqsa Flood Operation"", such as the guest and Marwan Issa.
In October 2024, after A year and ten days of the first anniversary of the October 7 attack, Sinwar was killed. Some strongly believe that his death was just a coincidence.
The killing of Al -Sinwar constituted a heavy blow to Hamas, which officially called it hours after the Israeli side confirmed its ""major military and moral achievement"". His deputy, Khalil al -Hayya, went out to read a statement in which he inherits the Sinwar, pledging to complete the fighting, saying: ""The killing of the Sinwar will not increase our movement and our resistance except strength and hardness.""

A number of senior Hamas leaders were killed during the Gaza war, and some strikes targeted them while they were outside the border, as happened with Saleh Al -Arouri, who died in bombing in the southern suburbs of Beirut.
As for Al -Sinwar, he was killed while on the battlefield, and his body was withdrawn from the theater of operations after an exchange of fire with an Israeli army force that was carrying out a routine patrol, which raided a building in the southern Gaza Strip on suspicion of ""the presence of armed men in it.""
In the midst of the engagement, the force did not know that Sinwar was one of the militants inside the building that they raided on the suspicion of the presence of ""gunmen inside it.""
In the next scene, the initial body was identified after wiping the site, then it was transferred for a criminal examination where it was done Ensure that Sinwar is eliminated, he announced.
The corners of the vision differed to the way the Sinwar spent, and there were conflicting interpretations; The Hamas narration promoted the idea that he ""remained suspicious until the last moment in his life,"" but in the Israeli narrative, he was killed as ""a victory for the free world.""
We tried to communicate with Hamas to comment on the reports that spoke that the restoration of the Sinwar's body was part of the negotiations with Israel, and we have not yet received a comment from it.
However, the Palestinian researcher, Mamoun Abu Amer, from Istanbul, told the BBC: “The talk about the corpse of Al -Sinwar was mentioned in the first stage of the armistice negotiations, but there was an Israeli reluctance, perhaps because of the character’s position and its leadership position, or other political considerations related to the idea that the deal was in An advanced stage, and that Israel mostly saw that its acceptance in handing over the body is not in its favor at that time, so she refused this so that it is not considered a concession In favor of Hamas. ""
Abu Amer stressed that Hamas did not ask the Sinwar body in particular, such as the bodies of the rest of the movement's deaths. Essential and will not be included in the basic terms of the agreement, and will not hinder the ceasefire or affect the progress of negotiations.
Abu Amer explains the matter by saying: ""It does not matter where their remains are (the dead of Hamas), wherever they are buried, they are buried and they will have symbolic consolation councils."" Nevertheless, Abu Amer does not deny the probability of resuming the enthusiasm of the Sinwar's body in the future.
However, he ruled out that Israel meets the enthusiasm of Hamas at the present time, and he continued: ""This delivery may be delayed, and I expect that the fate of the body will be determined according to the circumstances and conditions that may appear with the development of the current agreement on Gaza and its stages.""


On the other hand, Mair Cohen, a former Israeli diplomat, said in an interview with BBC Arabic: “I do not know specifically the nature of the deal in which the Sinwar corpse may be bartled. This may be done in a slow operation, and it may never happen. This will depend on considerations The occasion is according to the nature of each stage.
He added, ""We not only think about eradicating the male of Sinwar, but entirely enthusiasm, because it is a terrorist organization, and we have made us hostage and detained bodies for us several times for years, and this is one of its traditions.""
He added that Israel ""was unable to restore remains Sergeant Oron Shaul after his detention in the Gaza Strip in 2014 except in 2025, and this was achieved through a special secret operation for both the army and the Shin Bet (the Israeli Internal Security Service).
He continued, ""Since then, there is another corpse of Lieutenant Hadar Golden, which has not been retrieved from Gaza for more than a decade, and Israel has continued to work to restore it.""
And about how and when Israel might use the body of Sinwar, Mr. Cohen replied: ""There is no certain information about that, but some reports talked about that Israel may not hand it over before the guarantee of obtaining - at the very least - in return on the body of the Golden Hadar, and opened the file of each Of the Israeli of Ethiopian origin, Abraham Mengistu, and from the Arab Bedouins, Hisham El -Sayed, who were arrested in Gaza in 2014 and 2015, respectively.
Many are known about Hisham El -Sayed except that he descends from the Negev Bedouins.
On the authority of Lieutenant Golden, his academic parents commented on the X platform on the barter deals that are being implemented this period and wrote that ""Hadar has been neglected again."" While the Israeli side confirms his ""killing before the kidnapping of its body"" by Hamas fighters, the previous Palestinian armed movement insisted that it It was lost and that there was no information about it, before its military arm, the Al -Qassam Brigades, presented it in 2023 in the midst of the Gaza war with other soldiers detained since 2014, including Shaul, in addition to both Abraham Mengistu and Hisham El -Sayed, refusing to reveal any details related to With them without ""clear entitlements and prices.""
Regarding dealing with the bodies that are being seized by Israel after being recovered from the battles, Cohen replied that ""it is usually not announced details about this, but it is likely that they are in a place that is not announced, as it has a secret burial, noting that preserving Sinwar's body is undoubtedly a very important pressure paper. ""
Cohen believes that Hamas accounts to restore the corpse of Sinwar ""are not necessarily consistent with the accounts in the Palestinian street,"" which he believes ""will not care about that."" He asked, ""What does Sinwar symbolize specifically? And what did his people benefit from it for the past months?"" In reference to the confrontations that erupted in Gaza since October 7, 2023.

In their last war in Gaza and in previous conflicts, the two sides, Israel and Hamas, adopted the policy of retention ""The bodies of the enemies"" called it.
Successive Israeli governments direct attention to restoring all their missing people or recovering the bodies of those who were killed, and making a great effort in this context to give them decent burial procedures or the so -called ""Code Hamit"" (honoring the dead) for ideological reasons.
Israel also paid attention to collecting the bodies of the Palestinians; Especially those that concern people with a moral value in Hamas, just as it happened with Sinwar, based on the escalation of dependence on the logic of barter during the conflicts. The Israeli army declined to provide details to the internal media about the location of the body to keep the body and the possibility of returning it or not.
The political and diplomatic correspondence of the ""Times of Israel"" newspaper, Tal Schneider, told BBC Arabic that the Israeli media does not shed light on the fate of the Sinwar's body and the discussion episodes are not held around it, explaining that the occupation of the Israelis currently among all sectors is ""to restore this number of Our kidnapped hostages in Gaza since the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, and they are supposed to be still. Life "", describing the position as"" unprecedented crisis. ""
She added that there is preliminary appreciation information from the Israeli army On the killing of 35 of them, during the fifteen months of the war in Gaza, and that their bodies are in the possession of Hamas.
She added that it is difficult to predict the fate of the Sinwar's body before deciding the fate of the Israeli bodies suspended in Gaza.
But she ruled out that the step of handing over the remains of the Sinwar - even if the government accepted it - with a little popular support.
And what Israel might offer if it is not possible to hand over the body of Sinwar in exchange for what it will get in the discussions of the third stage of the armistice, Schneider replied: ""This can be compensated for other matters, especially in terms of reconstruction.""
It is said that Israel acted during the war to restore its death by itself.
According to the New York Times, there are pictures and satellite clips that were claimed to show the exhumation of Israel, the land of Gaza, including some graves, in search of the bodies of their dead. The American newspaper says that the Israeli army did not respond to its request for comment.
BBC spoke with Issam Arwi, director of the Jerusalem Center for Legal Assistance and Human Rights, who is following the file of restoring the bodies of the Palestinian dead.
The Palestinians revive the ""National Day to recover the bodies of the detained martyrs and reveal the fate of the missing"" on August 27 of each year.
And according to what Ayouri said to us in this regard. The center filed multiple lawsuits in order to release the bodies of the victims of the majority of them, ""as soon as it receives a legal mandate from their families."" He added: ""The cases that we dealt with were for various groups. Some of them were civilians, others were armed or suicide bombers. There were bodies belonging to Palestinians from the West Bank and others from the Gaza Strip or from the Israeli interior, or even for those who fell into clashes abroad or across the border Families want to recover the bodies of their children. ""
The group succeeded ""several times before the war in Gaza, in release under judicial procedures for 700 bodies of the numbers graves, which are sites for simple expression in Israeli military areas dug with a superficial depth, not names on them, but only numbers, so that no one distinguishes the identity of the bodies, except by returning For Israeli files, ""according to Al -Arouri.
He commented on this as ""insulting"", and added: ""As if the lying in it is just a number, although the perspective of Jewish law is the most strict in terms of preserving the body and the holiness of its burial.""
He added: ""We started our work to recover the bodies of the Palestinians from Israel in 2008, and the group followed each case individually, despite the length Delications for years in Israeli courts. Then matters were complicated because the Israeli Supreme Court authorized in 2018 amendment No. 3 to the anti -terrorism law, which authorizes the blocking of the bodies and deeds of the deceased Palestinians and imposing restrictions on their funerals.

Questions are still on the location of the Sinwar's body and its fate, as well as the fate of the bodies of other Israelis.
The paragraphs of the Geneva Convention of 1949, an international treaty to organize war, states that in cases of armed conflict or occupation, ""all possible measures"" must be taken to collect the dead bodies of the battlefield and bury them as soon as possible. The body must also be dealt with in line with the doctrine of its owner.
The agreement prohibits the inhuman treatment of the corpses, stresses the need to respect the dead and give them a generous burial, and that signs be placed on graves sites to facilitate identification, access and protection from any futility or abuse.
Moreover, the return of any corpse or remains must be facilitated to its families, in addition to its belongings, as soon as possible.",UK

"The US President, Donald Trump, fled the bomb of the displacement of the Palestinian people from Gaza on the twenty -fifth of last month (January), then reaffirmed it on later occasions with great insistence that the Gaza Strip will be emptied of its people, and that Egypt and Jordan are the destination, Then Trump continued his fraud, which was expanded, and Saudi Arabia, when Netanyahu said it was the right place to establish a Palestinian state. All of this, and the Arabs did not think about holding an emergency summit to discuss this madness except at the end of the first week of February, as they were determined for her the twenty -seventh of the same month, so that the wheel of preparatory meetings took place, and the disadvantaged obstacles from Arab parties that were all the time were closer to alignment with it The Israeli -American side in the aggression against Gaza.
It was the first stab of that Gulf capital, which carried out an early attempt to detonate the emergency Arab summary, with its insistence on changing the form of a unified Arab decision with an absolute refusal to displace the Palestinians from their lands, so the addition of the word ""forced"" to be the rejected Arab is only forced displacement, while there is no objection to voluntary displacement .
Later, enthusiasm began to hold the summit Little by little, in conjunction with what looks like a strange campaign in its context against the Palestinian resistance launched by Arab official diplomats, and politicians close to regimes calling for Hamas to leave the scene in Gaza, and considers it an obstacle in the way of reconstruction and the resumption of life in Gaza, which touched on the shame of Amin General of the League of Arab States, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, then he said very clearly the spokesperson for The university Hossam Zaki: ""The interest of Palestine requires Hamas's exit from the leadership of the sector in the current period,"" which is the meaning to which he went with the largest CEO of the United Company dominating the Egyptian media, Abdel Latif Al -Manawi, who went to hold ""Hamas"" and the resistance responsible for the Arab situation The present.
However, what makes the Arabic summary that they talk about is of no value or importance, or it is closer to the clowning in the place of the grandfather is that the date of its convening itself is no longer known or alone, after the actors in the Arab system decided to postpone it again to be on the fourth of March Given that the differences on the agenda and decisions are still ongoing, in addition to that many leaders are not interested in attending.
Witness to review Trump's tactical statements about his rude statements on the issue of possessing Gaza and the displacement of the Palestinian people from them, he found an immediate response from Arab rulers, whose concern was held to hold the summit (the emergency after a month and a half of the event calling for its holding), to start talking about quadruple summits between specific Arab parties, and other Arab -American.
All of this confirms that there is no hope to stop the Trump massacre that targets the history and geography of Palestine, except that the Arab peoples realize that they have existential roles other than the cursing of their excessive and frustrating rulers, who say something in public and do the opposite of it in secret.
All the data of the current moment says that there is no one for Palestine except for the Arab peoples, and therefore the sufficiency of the miserable moan becomes the weakness of the rulers, or the claim of weakness, in front of the American insult and the Zionist crime, in itself a form of collusion and contribution to the betrayal of Palestine, because these peoples are Do not put pressure, it can affect rulers that are identical to the will The American, and they only have before that they will think about how to implement this will to serve the interests of all, as the King of Jordan did in the hands of Donald Trump, Sitting on Netanyahu's seat in front of the American President's fireplace, which is made on its glow east of his new mediator.",UK

On Tuesday evening, Trump spoke at a press conference with a prime minister
Occupation
Israeli Benjamin Netanyahu about his country's intention to seize the Gaza Strip, a few days after his call The displacement of the people of the Strip, and their resettlement in other countries such as Egypt and Jordan.
Trump said after his conversations with Netanyahu at the White House,; ""The United States will take control of Gaza, and we will also make a mission in it,"" adding: ""We will launch an economic development plan (in the Strip), aimed at providing an unlimited number of jobs and housing for the residents of the region.""
The US President claimed that Gaza ""could become (after his country's control and development of it) Rvira Middle East."" He also did not rule out the possibility of deploying American forces to support the reconstruction of Gaza, expecting the United States to be ""long -term ownership"" in the Gaza Strip.
Trump's statements regarding the Gaza Strip sparked a wide wave of condemnation and rejection at the international and regional levels, amid calls to retreat from it and move forward in the course of the two -state solution.",QA
"US President Donald Trump's abandonment of his proposal was not completely surprising, nor Walid turns his mood to turn; Since the moment he declared his desire to seize Gaza to make it a real estate project, consultants, members of Congress and experts in American research centers have moved to persuade the White House to give up the idea. However, this proposal (or plan) was employed to pressure the Arab countries to develop an alternative project for the reconstruction of Gaza in accordance with American -Israeli conditions, and in order to achieve normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel.
Trump reaches political reasons and necessities, which is not only the result of Egypt and Jordan's refusal to displace the Palestinians into their lands, but because the influential circles in Washington considered the idea to undermine a normalization agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel. But she also saw in Trump's announcement an opportunity to pressure the Arab countries to provide an alternative, and hold it responsible for facing the consequences of the destruction of the Israeli extermination war on the Palestinians of Gaza, and to secure the conditions of the occupying state to a situation that guarantees its interests and security requirements in the devastating sector, did not succeed in imposing it in the war, which paves the way for the signing of a treaty A Saudi -Israeli, Washington did not give up One day to seek it.
The timing of Trump's statement, in which he announced his decline in his ""plan"" by coincidence, was not even accompanied by a ""informal"" Arab summit meeting in Riyadh the day before yesterday, and it is an indication that US officials were communicating with the summit and found that Trump's ideas that were considered Gaza land Permanently to the consequences of his family's wealth and group limits the ability of Arab leaders to provide alternative proposals. The first to challenge the Arab world to present an alternative project was the former veteran diplomat, Dennis Ross, from the Washington Institute for Near East Studies (Zionist orientation), which I referred to in my ""New Arab"" declaration (7/16/2023). Then we started hearing from US officials, most notably Foreign Minister Marco Rubio, who demanded the Arab countries to develop an alternative plan, which indicates, as always, the great influence of research centers, as it is not far from the American institutions and the Congress in its impact on making important decisions in Washington, especially if it is It is consistent with the American strategy. In this particular case, what matters is to accelerate the entry of Saudi Arabia in a normalized treaty with Israel, and to obtain an obligation from the Arab countries to finance the arrangements it suggests Israel and America regarding Gaza from Arab supervision of a transitional stage, and the administration of the Palestinian authority on new conditions and a responsible Washington, with the aim of controlling the residents of Gaza and ending the existence of Hamas or the emergence of any organization that poses a threat to Israel.
There are no homelands and rights for the people in Trump's greedy capitalist imagination
There are no homelands and rights for the people in Trump's greedy capitalist imagination
Israel rejected, from the beginning, that is, the presence of the Palestinian Authority, but the former US administration insisted on that, but the CIA director, William Burns, met with Palestinian figures to persuade her to take over the role, but he failed, so that one of the figures with whom she discussed cooperated with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas To thwart what Burns threw. It is not yet clear whether the Trump administration is ready to accept the role of power in the Gaza Strip, and it recently stopped financial aid to the Palestinian security forces. But it is an exclusive task of Trump envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkeov, the declared Zionist who participates in Trump's son -in -law Jared Kushner in his interest in exploiting Gaza Beach to tourism projects.
The important thing is that Trump announced the change of his position, which publicly regrets his abandonment The stealing of each Gaza Strip is openly, describing it as a ""beautiful plot of land"", and that he does not understand ""why the Israelis abandoned it"", there is no homelands and rights for the people in its greedy capitalist imagination. But the major American interests have priority over wishes, that is, the American Foundation was able to stop it at the end of it, at least in this case. This does not mean that this is the beginning of Trump curbing inside and outside America, but it is clear that his broader circle in the Republican Party also interfered, according to what this has shown the statements of the Republican Senator Lindsay Graham, who publicly and hardly rejected the idea of ??Trump for the future of Gaza, the American administrations, including the Trump administration in its previous state She succeeded in expanding the circle of Arab normalization, and achieved the Abrahamic treaty other than The predecessor in its construction of coalition agreements with Israel accepts the Zionist narration.
It is necessary to fear the Arab alternatives about Gaza, as governments put them that weakened themselves and accepted a ""functional"" role in the American interest system
It is necessary to fear the Arab alternatives about Gaza, as governments put them that weakened themselves and accepted a ""functional"" role in the American interest system
Trump retreated is important, but throwing the ball In the Arab Stadium, it is not intelligent from it and the effects affecting the decision in Washington, but because they found that the Arab countries do not take the initiative and make proposals that preserve the rights of the Palestinian people, but rather seek to find arrangements that are compatible, and the basis for American proposals to build a compromise, Usually it is accepted by American domination.
The rejection of Trump's proposal, which came as a threat to the stability of Egypt and Jordan, was a milestone in its clarity in a position and in response to the Americans, but the problem is that we entered into the stage of bargains, and this is the usual stage The deportation of their residents at the beginning of an operation of the displacement plan in the West Bank, tempted America and Israel to continue to impose Converting the sector into a isolated population group, with the aim of preventing it from rebuilding its Palestinian community, and breaking the ambition of the Palestinian people and their dream of freedom.
It is necessary to fear the Arab alternatives about Gaza, as governments put them that weakened themselves and accepted a ""functional"" role in the American interest system, and marginalized the role of their peoples and institutions, but some of them became hostage to agreements Israeli normalization, which deepened its dependency and strengthening the dominance of Israel, and has not even used the threat to freeze normalization and economic agreements, which made it more vulnerable to blackmail and American and Israeli pressures.
So; We have the right, and we must fear, or get angry, especially since it is completed, in the event of an Israeli -Saudi agreement, a link to adapting Arabs, regimes and the region and turning it into an Israeli American reserve, as the current danger is not only on the Palestinians; Rather, every citizen in the Arab countries from the ocean to the Gulf. It is a similar moment, and worse, from the eve of the Flood of Al -Aqsa, when America was about to declare an overwhelming victory over the Palestinians and the Arabs by kidnapping Saudi Arabia to the coalition camp with Israel ... Is there anyone who pays attention or cares between Arab regimes that see the resistance a greater danger than Israel? !",UK

He collected Trump's phone call to the head of the Egyptian regime, Abdel Fattah
Sisi
, Saturday.
Communication raised a lot of controversy and pushed to ask many questions, especially with what appeared to be a conflict about those who made contact with the other, as the Egyptian presidential statement confirmed that Trump was the initiative to call, while the US presidential statement said that Sisi was the one who contacted Trump.
The White House statement said: ""On Saturday, President Donald Trump received a phone call from President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi,"" while the statement of the official spokesman for the Egyptian Presidency of the Republic carried the title ""President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi, this evening, received a phone call from US President Donald Trump.
""Ignore the displacement file""
In reading observers, and media professionals, including the broadcaster in ""MBC Egypt"", Amr Adib, it appears from the expanded and brief Egyptian statement, a great compatibility during The contact between Trump and Sisi, although the two papers did not talk to any talk about the displacement file.
The Egyptian statement confirmed that the communication touched on the talk about peace in the Middle East and the Nile water file between Egypt and Ethiopia, pointing to Sisi's call to Trump and his family, next summer to open the Grand Museum in Cairo, and the call of Trump, Sisi, to visit Washington, without mentioning an appointment for the invitation.
The Egyptian or American local newspapers did not address what happened between Trump and Sisi, about the file of the displacement of the Palestinians, except for the American ""Axius"" website, which wrote a news about Saturday's call, titled ""Trump is talking to the Egyptian President about the plan to evacuate the Palestinians from Gaza,"" noting that Until they discussed Trump's idea to transport two million Palestinians to Egypt and Jordan to rebuild the sector.
This prompted observers, including the writer Jamal Sultan, to ask the question: ""Why did Sisi hide from the Egyptian people this information in his statement yesterday about his contact with Trump, which is the most important and most dangerous thing in the matter, but rather the talk of the hour?"" About the displacement, he indicates that ""there is a darkening door, and there is a perpetrator, and there is something that worries what is going on in the closed rooms.""
Restore or buy loyalty?
It is considered This is the first contact made by Trump and Sisi, after returning to the White House in a new presidential state, and launching his statements regarding the displacement from Gaza, January 25, and after his response to a press question about the possibility of accepting Egypt and Jordan by displacing Palestinians from Gaza, saying: You will do so. ""
Egypt was the only country, along with Israel, which obtained an exemption from Trump's decision to freeze all US foreign aid.

Commenting on Egypt's position, Sisi, regarding the Trump plan, the American magazine ""Newsweek"" said last Friday that ""the relationship between America and Egypt is undoubtedly important, but what is happening in Gaza will not remain in Gaza, and the unequal situation from Cairo may push at the end Its reassessment of its value. ""
She pointed out that some of the issues that Egypt suffers from, noting that ""the worsening economic crisis increases matters complicated, since Sisi took power, he supervised the high inflation, paralyzed debts, and high unemployment, and that internal discontentment is high, and social disturbances are looming on the horizon."" He believed that ""this may open the door for American aid to buy Egyptian loyalty Renewed.
""Netanyahu in Washington and incitement against Cairo.""
Trump and Al -Sisi's call came one day before the departure of the Prime Minister of the Occupation Government Benjamin Netanyahu, on Sunday, to Washington to meet Trump, amid many files that are possible to discuss, including the Gaza file and the issues of the prisoners ’exchange, the end of the war, the status of the sector, and the displacement.
Trump's demands coincide with displacement with an Israeli incitement against Cairo, in which observers saw an attempt to pressure the Trump plan, as the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danone, warned of the growing military arsenal of the Egyptian army, in a rare statement at the official level in Tel Aviv, according to the description of the website. East with Bloomberg. ""
According to the ""Jerusalem Post"", the senior Israeli official called on Washington to reconsider the supply of Egypt with weapons, asking: ""We have to ask America why Egypt needs all this equipment?""
In their reading of the connotations of communication between Sisi and Trump, after the Egyptian public rejection of the plan of displacement, and the possibilities of the Egyptian position to take the direction of relegation after the escalation of Friday demonstrations, and the possibilities that they took place between Trump and Sisi bargaining to accept the displacement, experts and politicians spoke to ""Arabi 21"".
“Who does not have and not I can
The Egyptian political researcher Yahya Saad said: ""When statements and behaviors are absurd, they do not deserve to stress the mind in its connotations. What Trump requested is a futile matter that indicates ignorance of the nature of the invading personality that refuses to humiliate and underestimate its cause.""
The researcher specializing in political education, added to ""Arabi 21"": ""He also shows a neglect of the grave sacrifices made by the people of Gaza over a period of 15 months without seeking immigration outside their land despite the virginity of murder and the bitterness of movement, from one place to another, inside Gaza.""
He asked, ""How can Trump imagine that what the Ghazi people rejected throughout the war can be accepted after the war was laid down?""
On the issue of decline and ascension in the Egyptian position, Saad believes that ""the current system cannot anger the White House inhabitant and cannot do so, but the data around him does not enable him to fulfill Trump's desire, and if he finds a way that is what was reported.""
He continued: ""Therefore, he invoked the conduct of artificial absurd demonstrations to depict that it is the Egyptian people who reject Trump's request, knowing that if there was a real freedom for the Egyptian people to express his opinion, his speech would be said to refuse to displace strongly without making or acting.""
He went on to say: ""If there was a real freedom And a real democracy in the Egyptian political environment, Trump has not been able to request this request at all, ""stressing that"" Trump's request is a request for those who do not have those who cannot. ""
It is believed that ""the lesson that this controlled system must learn is that whoever wants to embody its people, then it should not weaken it, and that in order to be strong with real sovereignty, it must stand behind a free society that is able to be able to not be a herd that the ruler markes whenever he wants and suppresses him with his stick whenever he wants.""
The Egyptian researcher concluded by saying: ""As for what is below that, it is absurd and absurdity that is not appropriate for Egypt, its history, or its people.""
""This is what scares Sisi.""
In his vision, the Egyptian politician Reda Fahmy said: “My conviction is that Sisi is not rejecting the displacement, neither in principle nor in terms of the current circumstance, and I see that he would have gone to the fullest extent in the file of displacement, but at first he wanted to enter into a kind of negotiation to get The highest possible gains. ""
The head of the National Security Committee of the former Egyptian People's Assembly, and in his interview with ""Arabi 21"" stressed that ""what happened is that the reports of Egyptian security and intelligence services were issued, confirming that the displacement, if it would represent a kind of direct threat to Sisi, personally.""
He pointed out that ""these reports indicated that those coming from Gaza Whatever their number is half a million or 700 million more or less, they came from the womb of suffering and lived under the fire and transferred this culture to the Egyptian interior and building networks of interests in the Egyptian interior, which warns of an irreplaceable danger.
Hence, Fahmy sees that ""the first dimension is that the issue is not in its acceptance, rejection, or by standing before Trump, but the issue has become touched by its existence and threatens it personally.""
He pointed out that ""the other dimension, is the question: Was Trump, Sisi and even Israel are already able to do this process in the way that Trump proposes?"" The fire was the displacement of the internal Palestinian people, and their insistence on returning in swarms to their homes, villages and destroyed cities.
The Egyptian writer and political researcher believes that ""for this, the decision of displacement is not owned by Trump, Israel, or Sisi, and whoever owns it is only the Palestinian people,"" noting the possibility of ""a kind of pressure and restrictions on the Palestinians to impose displacement, and this is possible, but the numbers that come out will be Outside the lands of Palestine is mostly limited. ""
Fahmy said, ""The subject Displacement, even if it fails or stumbled, Sisi has restored his head from the issue of the existential threat to his rule, and the same talk about King Abdullah, where the Palestinians in Jordan represent about 65 percent of the total population, and if the displacement occurs to Jordan, it will become a Palestinian and Jordanian minority according to the division (Sykes -Picot ) And cut the area according to a Western vision.
He stressed that ""the Arabian Gulf will say Amen as long as Trump said,"" asking: ""Does this mean that the region is still working with the American remote control in a completely?"" Biden reduced oil prices, which means that they can refrain from some files; but the equation for any extent can refrain from File.

But where do things go? The Egyptian politician emphasized that ""it is not clear, especially since Trump is pressing his weight, and when he put his plan he knew that Sisi and Abdullah welcomed, and the papers were not mixed with two things; the first: the security reports issued, and said that the displacement represents a threat to the regime in Egypt , And it was dangerous to the future of stability in Egypt in general in the Sisi period And after him.
And that ""the other thing is related to the possibility of Trump forcibly the implementation of the displacement, without a new explosion of the situation in the region, and this may also be within the Trump calculation.""
Fahmy believes that ""the model that is now in the Egyptian General Intelligence belongs to the School of the Head of Intelligence, Hosni Mubarak, Major General Omar Suleiman, and that the new intelligence chief Hassan Rashad was within this school that was based on extreme flexibility at the time of strong winds and then returning to its places.""
He stressed that ""they may have experiences to empty the topic from its content, if you will, by earning time until new facts and events occur, according to Suleiman's famous method, and in my estimation that there are no multiple solutions in front of the Egyptian side other than procrastination, procrastination, dribbling and trying to win the time until the issue fails Or to cover him with other events. ""
""From the calls for the accusation""
Activists expressed their concerns, which may leave Trump and Sisi's contact with neglect and assignment, after others spoke about the need to line up with Sisi, in his rejection of Trump's directives, giving him a prescription and solutions to get out of the crisis, including resorting to the Egyptian people, opening the door of freedoms and release of detainees, returned Fears of Sisi's refusal, in public, hides other things behind him.
""After the popular crowd, which is summoned by Sisi to reject Trump's invitation to displace and displace Al -Ghazawiya, Sisi - according to the Egyptian presidential statement - was invited to Trump to visit Egypt at the earliest opportunity,"" said the Sinai Ashraf Ashraf Ashine Ashyoub said. Trump for Riyadh is 600 billion dollars, directing his question to Sisi: How much will you pay in Trump's visit to Cairo or what it will Get waive?
The Egyptian politician Shadi Al -Ghazali Harb had called for Sisi to open a new page with the people, as a single solution, to change the political climate, the exit of all detainees of opinion, the launch of freedom of expression and political action, and the building of real popular legitimacy, which does not depend on repression and violation of human rights.
Some called on Sisi to join the international coalition consisting of South Africa, Malaysia, Colombia, Bolivia, Cuba, Honduras, Namibia, Senegal and Blaze Islands, on Friday evening, in the name of ""The Hague Group"", with the aim of working to end the Israeli occupation of the lands of Palestine and support the right of its people In determining his fate and establishing an independent state.",QA

Nabhan Khreisha: Trump will rethink new mechanisms and appropriate alliances to implement his plan, but he will realize that his project is not an inevitable destiny
D. Aqel Salah: Trump has not decreased permanent

On the impact of international protests, US President Donald Trump seemed to have declined even if formally fell in his previous statements regarding the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, amid warnings that this would be a tactical decline, not a strategic decline, especially since Trump returned to confirm that he is ""not in a hurry"". To implement this scheme.

Political writers and analysts see And specialists and university professors in separate conversations with ""?"" that this decline in Trump does not reflect the abandonment of the idea, but rather a temporary calming step, in light of the American administration's awareness that collective displacement represents a flagrant violation of international law, and its regional and international interests may endanger.

The writers, analysts, university professors and specialists confirm that the American-Israeli plan for displacement is not new, but rather reflects the essence of Zionist policies, and the implementation of this project may be done gradually by drying the ways of life in Gaza, and creating a repulsive environment for the population, which may lead the Palestinians to ""voluntary"" immigration under The severe circumstances, but in contrast, the continuation of international and Arab pressure may force Trump On reassessing his position, especially if his political cost becomes higher than possible benefits.

On the other hand, the writers, analysts, specialists and university professors see that Trump, who pursues the method of bargaining and political blackmail, may use the issue of displacement, a pressure card in the context of his negotiation with regional parties, where he can offer to stop the implementation of the plan in exchange for making political or economic concessions.

A state of retreat, confusion and hesitation

The writer sees And the political analyst d. Ahmed Rafik Awad that US President Donald Trump's statement that he is ""not in a hurry"" to implement a plan to displace Palestinians from the Gaza Strip reflects a state of retreat, confusion and hesitation, and perhaps temporary abandonment of the idea, the proposal that Trump launched with ""Jazaj, ignorance and stupidity"" faced a wave of Strong reactions at international and regional levels, which led him to reconsider his plan, or at least the slowdown in its implementation.

Awad asserts that one of the main reasons behind Trump's retreat from the implementation of his plan at the present time is that the mass displacement of the Palestinians represents a flagrant violation of international law and humanitarian law, and it also contradicts the traditional American policies that were reluctantly dependent on the conflict administration instead of igniting it with displacement projects Collective, adopting such an idea means that the United States turns its back completely for everything that has been agreed upon internationally in relation to The Palestinian issue, which may harm its global position and relations with allied countries.

Awad believes that the mass displacement of the Palestinians is not only a humanitarian catastrophe, but rather that it harms Israel itself, as it harms its allies in the region. The path of settlement and normalization that Israel has sought to establish with the Arab countries threatens during the past three decades. If the plan is implemented, the Israeli -Arab relations will be subjected to dangerous vibrations, and may end completely, because the systems that have signed normalization agreements will find themselves facing their angry peoples, and they will not be able To justify its continued relationship with Israel in light of the displacement of the Palestinians and the liquidation of their cause.

Awad notes that the displacement plan puts moderate Arab regimes in a great dilemma, because it is impossible to agree to the displacement and be able to liquidate the Palestinian issue. This means that the Arab regimes will pay a heavy price that they do not want to pay, which may lead to a complete collapse of the path of settlements reached during the past decades.

Awad Trump describes as a real estate and broker man in nature, and does not think about history, national identities, rights, and international laws, but rather he simply follows his interest wherever he finds it, so his statements do not mean that he has completely retracted the idea, but may search for a better opportunity to apply it in The future is as a businessman who used to On bargaining, barter and negotiation, and knows that there is a great political cost to implement his plan at this time, and therefore its decline may be merely a tactical maneuver until the appropriate conditions are created.

And he stresses that the mass displacement of the Palestinians is not an American idea, but rather the essence of the Zionist project itself, as the Zionist thought since its foundation is based on ""more land, less Arabs"", and ""land without a people for a people without land"", and this doctrine did not leave the mentality of Israeli leaders, but rather It is presented every few years, then it is postponed if it faces difficulties, but the idea does not die, but the appropriate opportunity is awaited to implement it.

Awad notes that Trump's retreat from the displacement project is not abandoning it, but rather a temporary calm, with the aim of avoiding violent reactions and rearranging political papers, because the Israelis do not stop thinking about the displacement, but they postpone the implementation until the appropriate opportunity comes, and Tram, which reflects Israeli desires More than being an independent decision -maker, he may return again to this plan, if he sees that the conditions allow this in the future.

Long -term project requires preliminary procedures

The writer and political analyst Akram Atallah refers to what the president means The American Donald Trump is that he is not in a way to implement a plan to displace Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, as he realizes that such a project cannot be implemented overnight, but rather a long -term project, which requires preliminary measures such as voluntary migration and drying the ways of life in the sector, which leads to the creation of An environment of pressure that ultimately pushes the Palestinians to leave.

Atallah notes that the implementation of the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Gaza population does not depend on Arab or international reactions, as Trump does not pay any attention, and this was explicitly explained when he spoke about Egypt and Jordan, indicating that they may be assumed at the beginning, but they will eventually accept Without this objection has a significant effect.

Atallah confirms that Trump's position on this project is related to several factors, including his personal interests associated with his companies, in addition to the Israeli desire that plays a pivotal role in strengthening this trend.

It indicates that the project enjoys the support of a major state represented by Israel and its lobbies, which makes it realistic for Trump, and even in the event that the displacement is not successful, it may take advantage of the idea to bargain and political tactics, such as Saudi demanding normalization with Israel in exchange for stopping Deportation, which makes it a project standing until the moment.

Atallah stresses that Trump is not the owner of the idea, but rather a translation of the Israeli desire and program. As he was provided with documents, projects, and video materials, which support him in adopting this proposal, which made him repeat what Israel wants completely, and therefore, Trump's retreat from the idea will not happen unless Israel abandoned it first, it is merely a façade to implement this scheme.

As for the only scenario that may push Trump to decline, according to Atallah, it is the intensification of counter -pressure to become larger and stronger than Israeli pressure, whether at the Arab or international level. He does this automatically, and even under pressure that exceeds the Israeli influence on it.

Decline an attempt to save the Treb Line line

The professor of political science at Hebron University, Dr. Bilal Al -Shobaki, confirms that the statements of US President Donald Trump regarding his lack of urgency in implementing the proposal to displace the people of Gaza and occupy the Gaza Strip may be caused by the wide and angry reactions to his proposal, as it was not limited to the Palestinians and the Arabs, but rather It also included political levels Western.

Al -Shobaki notes that such statements may have come from some of his advisers who realized that the idea about the displacement of the people of Gaza and the occupation of the Gaza Strip has sparked sharp criticism, which makes their implementation currently unrealistic.

Al -Shobaki notes that converting this proposal into an implementable scheme requires the presence of partner parties that exceed the United States and Israel, which is not available at the present time.

It is believed that the retreat from the declaration of Trump, albeit outwardly, may be an attempt to preserve the line of reaction in the event of Trump's failure or any party supporting him in implementing this idea in the future.

According to Al -Shobaki, Trump's reading and advisers to the situation in Gaza, along with international interactions, led them to the conclusion that the idea is not applicable in the foreseeable term.

However, Al -Shobaki did not rule out the possibility of re -introducing the idea of ??displacement or the occupation of Gaza in the future if the appropriate conditions are prepared, likely that these statements will be employed politically, more than a current practical step, so that it is used as a extortion and political investment card to pressure the Palestinians and dwarf the ceiling of their negotiating demands.

Al -Shobaki explains that such strategies are not new, but rather an approach American-Israeli classically in dealing with Palestinian and Arab rights and aspirations, at a time when the traditional Palestinian demand was to end the occupation and achieve an independent state on the borders of 1967, the negotiating ceiling may be manipulated to become just ensuring that the Palestinians remain in their lands, instead of talking about ending the occupation Or lifting the siege.

Al-Shobaki believes that these statements may also be used in the context of US-Israeli relations with some Arab countries, especially in the course of normalization, instead of pushing towards establishing a Palestinian state, the new offering may be to keep the Palestinians within their current borders without real sovereign rights, including It contributes to a broader normalization with some Arab countries, especially Saudi Arabia.

Israel and its allies will not quit the idea of ??displacement

As for the possibility of Israel abandoning the idea of ??displacement, Al -Shobaki stresses that Israel and its allies have not and will not take off from this idea, but the current circumstances do not allow it to implement it directly, but Al -Shobaki believes that the decisive factor here is the lack of a political and diplomatic environment capable of supporting example This scheme.

Al -Shobaki confirms that instead of It is sufficient to condemn these American and Israeli statements, there should be a Palestinian counter -proposition based on strategies to establish the Palestinians on their lands, and to enhance their political and social presence, to prevent the passage of any plan aimed at weakening the Palestinian presence or forcibly displacing it.

Seek to reshape international awareness about the idea of ??displacement

A professor of political science at Al -Quds Open University, Dr. Qusai Hamed, that US President Donald Trump is seeking to reshape international awareness towards the idea of ??displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, so that it becomes one of the options presented within the future solutions to the tragedy in the Strip, and thus its legitimacy.

Hamed notes that Trump's main goal is to wrap the idea of ??displacement with a ""human nature"" and to present it as a ""optimal"" solution to address the humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip.

Hamed considers that this aims to transform attention from the crimes of war and the Israeli aggression in Gaza, which caused this humanitarian catastrophe to the legitimacy of the idea of ??displacement as one of the possible solutions, as the principle of proposed displacement is based on stabilizing Israel's occupation of the Strip and even annexing it as part of it.

Hamed warns that the most dangerous thing that can happen is that Trump succeeds in making the international community, including the Arab and Palestinian countries themselves, deal with displacement as if it is a realistic and possible solution, and to transform the idea of ??displacement from an undesirable scenario to a proposal to be discussed at human and international levels.

Regarding whether Trump's proposal is a real or just political tactic, Hamed explains that Trump is aware of the difficulty The idea of ??displacement is more acceptable as a human solution to the aggravating human reality in the sector.

The most dangerous aspect of Trump's offering, as Hamid sees, is an attempt to impose greater pressure on Arab countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, to create the atmosphere to implement this idea.

Hamed believes that Trump will keep the issue of displacement as a pressure tool for Hamas and the Arab countries, especially Saudi Arabia, and procrastinating the reconstruction of Gaza, and keeping it an inner place as part of the political extortion strategy.

Hamed believes that the timing of Trump's proposal is aimed at linking the progress of the following stages of the deal to bargaining ""Hamas"" to make concessions such as approval Removing its leaders from Gaza, and dismantling its military wing, to retract this proposal, and on the other hand, Saudi Arabia's bargaining to abandon the linking of normalization with Israel to the establishment of a Palestinian state, in exchange for abandoning the idea of ??displacement.

Regarding Trump's lack of urgency to implement the idea of ??displacement, Hamed believes that this is not a retreat from the idea, but rather a deliberate tactic to calm Arab and international reactions, while continuing to keep the idea in the discussion.

According to Hamed, Trump's advisory team, as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is well aware that the previous Israeli policies that sought to displace the Palestinians in Gaza greatly failed to achieve this goal, and therefore, Trump's successive statements about the displacement aim to keep the discussion alive about This idea without giving it up.

Hamed believes that the idea of ??displacement comes in the context of the United States and Israel attempts to reshape international awareness, towards accepting this scenario as part of the international community's efforts to alleviate the human suffering in the Gaza Strip.

Wild capitalism in its ugliest form

Journalist Nabhan Khreisheh believes that US President Donald Trump's statements are postponed Implementing his plan to displace the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip is not only returning to the Arab and international opposition and even within the United States, but there are other reasons that led him to declare that he is not in a hurry.

This announcement, according to Khreisha, does not mean that Trump abandoned the idea, but it simply does not put it on the top of his priorities at the present time, as he was busy in the early hours of his mandate with other files, such as strengthening the American economy by imposing customs duties on the imports of China, Canada and Mexico, In addition to implementing his strict policies against immigration.

According to Khuraisha, Trump revealed his willingness to send American forces to Gaza to implement his plan, which includes the displacement of the Palestinians and the establishment of the ""Rvira Middle East"" project, which reflects the wild capitalism in its ugliest form, and returns to mind the direct military colonialism that prevailed before the Second World War, And after the war, it turned into soft colonialism based on economic domination and the exploitation of the natural resources of other countries, which is What Trump is trying to implement in Gaza through huge real estate and investment projects.

Although Trump announced the postponement of the displacement project, Khreisha believes that this decline Tactical, not strategic, as it will rethink new mechanisms and suitable alliances to implement it in the long run.

Khreisha believes that Trump is working to reshape political alignments in the Middle East to serve his personal and economic interests, citing his relationship with the Saudi ""Global"" company, where he invested with it in the project of building luxury villas in the Omani capital, Muscat, at a cost of 200 million dollars.

Khreisha explains that one of the reasons for Trump's announcement of his lack of urgency in implementing the project is to realize the difficulty of sending American forces to Gaza, and the inability to harness the United States' political, military and financial capabilities to serve his own projects, so he needs a ""bartering"" deal with Netanyahu, which requires Israel to resume Israel The war on Gaza, with the aim of destroying any hope for the reconstruction of the Strip, and the tightening of the siege on the entry of humanitarian aid, which may lead the Palestinians to emigrate Forced.

Khreisheh notes that in return, Trump guarantees Israel's military, politically and financially support, and perhaps recognizing its sovereignty on the West Bank or parts of it, which will enable it to increase the frequency of killing and destruction in The West Bank, with the aim of pushing the Palestinians there to migrate as well. If this scenario is achieved, Trump will find an open path to conclude commercial deals with Israeli companies to implement his projects in Gaza, including tourist resorts, entertainment facilities, and oil and gas exploration in its territory and coasts.

It indicates that the assessments of the psychologists of Trump's personality confirm that he is an unpredictable person, as he never recognized the defeat, even in the most difficult moments of bankruptcy in the nineties, or during his many investment mistakes, he sees himself always victory, and suffers from complex narcissistic disorders that make him refuse to recognize failure .

However, despite all these accounts, Khreisha asserts that Trump will realize sooner or later that his project is not an inevitable destiny, and that the Palestinians are not an increase in humanity, just as they are not a red Indians, because the Palestinian people, in Gaza and all its whereabouts, will remain steadfast, and will not allow By passing the plans to uproot him from his land.

Trump seeks to impose solutions in line with his political interests

The writer and political researcher, Dr. Salah's mind is that US President Donald Trump's retreat from his statements about the displacement of the Gaza Strip's residents is due to The regional and international reactions that were met, in addition to the internal opposition in the United States.

According to Salah, Trump's statements about the displacement are inconsistent with international legitimacy and humanitarian laws, which made it expose American democracy to severe pressure, prompting Trump to adopt a more calm position after realizing the size of the shock caused by his statements at all levels.

Salah notes that Trump was seeking through his statements to test reactions by the parties concerned, with the aim of drawing a future policy in line with his political interests.

Salah believes that Trump's retreat from offering the idea of ??displacement is currently only an attempt to alleviate the situation and reduce the effects of his failed statements, which were subjected to severe criticism.

However, Salah confirms that Trump's retreat does not mean that he has finally retracted the implementation of his plan to displacement, but may return his plan to pressure the Palestinians and Arabs to agree to solutions that are in line with his policy such as normalization with Israel and the solutions he raises on the Palestinian issue.

Salah reviews some previous details related to the context of Trump's policy, indicating that Trump is the American president who dared to transfer The American embassy to Jerusalem, as it was the one who announced the ""deal of the century"" in its early stages.

In this context, Salah believes that the plan to displace Palestinians from Gaza represents a continuation of the ""deal of the century"", which includes two parts: the first is related to the solution of the Palestinian -Israeli conflict, while the second is a tactic to achieve Israeli expansionist goals.

Salah confirms that the American plan seeks to impose a ""solution to acceptance of the fait accompli"" based on the establishment of a Palestinian self -rule within a limited state, and the expansion of settlements in the West Bank, in addition to a comprehensive normalization with Arab countries, especially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Salah describes what Trump presents as a ""shock theory"" aimed at providing solutions accelerating in an attempt to force everyone to accept them.

Salah believes that Trump's statements come in the service of the Netanyahu government, which benefit from the continuation of the extreme right -wing rule in Israel.

And he confirms that the American institutions, including the Trump team, are fully aware that the idea of ??displacement of Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank is in violation of international law and will not be implemented on the ground, but the real goal lies in exploiting these statements to force Arab countries to accept In normalization with Israel, and thus imposing solutions that end the Palestinian issue at the expense of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.

Salah believes that Trump's statements regarding the displacement aim to exercise more pressure on Arab countries, such as Saudi Arabia, to accept the idea of ??""autonomy"" for the Palestinians instead of establishing an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 borders, which reflects an Israeli vision that seeks to liquidate the Palestinian issue and confirm Israel in the region .",PS

D. Mahmoud Al -Farah: What is required is not to be satisfied with condemnation, but to build on them through extensive political and diplomatic moves to obstruct the Trump scheme

It was only a few hours before US President Donald Trump's statements regarding the occupation of the Gaza Strip and the displacement of its population, until it sparked widespread international condemnation, amid warnings that these statements constitute a serious violation of international law and a threat to regional and global stability.

A book, political analysts, university professors and specialists, in separate conversations with ""?"", believes that the statements made by Trump reminds Hitler's policies, which then raised the outbreak of World War II, which prompted The world to attack these statements to Trump, while his assistants sought to try to alleviate those statements.

They point out that these condemnation comes in the context of a global rejection of Trump's populist orientations that contradict international legitimacy decisions, especially with regard to the Palestinian issue, while international positions indicate increasing concern that the continuation of such statements may enhance instability in the region, and open The door for an unprecedented escalation that threatens international peace and security, especially since Trump's statements were not limited to the Palestinian issue, but rather extended to a threat Other sovereign countries, which has caused criticism even among the United States' traditional allies.

The writers, analysts, specialists and university professors confirm that the condemnation alone is not sufficient, but rather they must turn into practical steps to prevent any attempts to impose new facts that contradict international law.

A clear bias for international law and legitimacy decisions

The writer and political analyst, Dr. Omar Rahal, confirms that the extensive international condemnations of US President Donald Trump's statements regarding the displacement and occupation of Gaza residents reflect a clear bias to international law and international legitimacy decisions, especially the Security Council The international and the United Nations General Assembly, as well as specialized international organizations, which confirm that the Palestinian lands are occupied lands, and their legal status may not be violated, as it emphasizes the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people in their land.

Rahal explains that these condemnation also comes against the background of Trump's violation of the United Nations Charter, especially its purposes and principles contained in Articles (1) and (2) of the Charter, as the Charter confirms the development of friendly relations between nations, and it is prohibited to use force or waving them, as It prevents the threat of independence and sovereignty of states.

Rahal notes that these statements were not limited to Gaza, but rather have affected other sovereignty and members of the United Nations, NATO and the European Union, which threatens international relations and fuels global tensions.

Rahal stresses that Trump's positions bring back to mind the approach followed by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler before World War II, when he was talking about the ""vital field"" and the occupation of states.

Rahal explains that the world does not want to repeat this scenario, as he realizes the risk of Trump's statements that may lead to the aggravation of international relations and the increased possibilities of widespread disputes, Even a new world war.

Rahal believes that Trump is behaving with the logic of the ""emperor"", reviewing the force in an irresponsible way, which prompted many countries to condemn his statements as illegal, unreasonable and irresponsible.

He points out that Trump has a history of provocative statements, such as his talk about the inclusion of Greenland from Denmark, the restoration of Panama channel, and the annexation of Canada, which are unprecedented in international relations and reflects his ""reckless"" style, which sometimes reveals ignorance in dealing with geopolitical issues.

Rahal stresses that there is a global concern about the possibility of the outbreak of a third world war, due to the political behavior of the American president and the personality of the Narcissism President, especially since the United States has military and economic capabilities to fight such wars, in light of Trump's policies governed by economic interests in the first place.

He explains that Trump seems to be as if he does not listen to his advisers before making his statements, as he improvises and behaves according to the logic of the merchant and businessman, and not as president of a superpower, yet he must take his statements seriously, and not to underestimate them.

Rahhal notes that Trump's recent statements prompted his aides to try to provide Interpretations and justifications to alleviate their severity, as they tried to suggest that he had no intention to send American forces to Gaza, which reflects his complete lack of awareness of the consequences of his words, but (and for his assessments) that are sometimes incomprehensible.

""These attitudes indicate that Trump speaks without responsibility, as if he was running a private company and not a country that leads the world order,"" said Rahhal.

Rahal notes that Trump's advisers appear to realize that the management of countries is radically different from the management of companies, and therefore Trump's aides are rushing to justify his statements that fuel the relations between the United States and its allies, especially the Arab countries that have strategic relations with Washington.

Rahal notes that these statements have caused ""disappointment"" among America's allies from the Arab countries in the Middle East, which prompted his aides to try to send messages of reassurance to clarify his position.

Rahal notes that Trump's statements about Gaza will not be translated into reality through a direct American occupation, but rather comes within his approach to using statements and situations as negotiating papers to pressure the various parties in the Middle East, which makes them in a defensive position, as if the mouthpiece says, ""He raises alternatives In front of the Palestinians and the Arabs, in exchange for a stop Aggression. ”

Rahal warns that the continuation of this extremist discourse may increase the complexity of the international scene and the aggravation of international relations, and puts the world in front of serious challenges that go beyond the Palestinian issue to the threat of international peace and security.


Global rejection of the populist approach to Trump

The head of the Department of Political Science at An -Najah National University, Dr. Raed Al -Dabi, explains that the extensive international condemnation of the positions of the US President, Donald Trump, reflects a global rejection of the populist approach that follows it, both in relation to international policies in general or the Palestinian issue in particular.

Al -Dambi notes that many Trump's policies were controversial, especially with regard to his expansionist tendency, which were not limited to the Middle East, but rather extended to major international issues, and included decisions that affected the international system in general.

With regard to the Middle East, Al -Damai explains that Trump's policies towards the Palestinian issue were part of his approach that contradicts international legitimacy decisions, and reflects clear attempts to impose a new reality that contradicts international decisions and international consensus on a two -state solution.

Al -Dabai stresses that the world is looking very anxiously to the fate of these policies And its impact on international security and stability, especially in light of previous historical experiences with populist leaders such as Hitler and Moussalini, who led the world to a devastating war that killed hundreds of millions.

Al -Dambi notes that international anxiety is multiplied in light of the technological development and the revolution of artificial intelligence, which has entered directly in the military field.

Al -Dabi asserts that the international community, including the United States' traditional allies, reject the unilateral approach that Trump is seeking to impose, especially in light of the rise of other powers such as China and Russia.

Al -Dambi notes that the recent Hague initiative, which was launched against the Israeli occupation and its expansionist policies, reflects an increasing global rejection of the American policies led by Trump, which is based on the principle of dictates instead of dialogue and diplomatic negotiation.

Regarding the Palestinian issue, Al -Damai explains that the international condemnation of Trump's statements on Gaza comes in the context of defending the two -state solution, and rejecting any policies or plans that lead to its undermining.

Al -Dambi stresses that these condemnation not only reflects support for the Palestinian issue, but also international fears that Trump's policies will destabilize the region, Including Israel itself as a liberal and pluralistic state.

Al -Dabi stresses that the international condemnation of Trump's statements about Gaza is not just diplomatic reactions, but rather reflects a true concern of extremist populist orientations that threaten the stability of the world and enhance conflicts instead of resolving them through dialogue and negotiation.

Al -Dabi explains that Trump adopts a provocative policy that is not limited to the Middle East, but also extends to the United States' traditional allies, which reflects an unprecedented escalation in international relations, and increases the tensions that may extend within the borders of those countries, threatening global security and stability.

Al -Dambi notes that the fears of the major countries about Trump's approach are also due to the ""domino"" theory, as it cannot be predicted to what extent can its expansion ambitions reach, which raises the concern of other countries that fear that it will be targeted later from its unexpected policies.

As for Trump's attempts to alleviate his statements, especially with regard to the possibility of sending American forces to Gaza, Al -Dabi explains that these clarifications come within the framework of absorbing internal and international anger.

It indicates that these ""trains"" reflect the size of the internal and external opposition to this The statements, especially by American politicians and Washington's allies, as everyone realizes that an American military intervention in Gaza will be unprecedented, and the United States will enter into a complex and dangerous conflict.

Al -Dambi stresses that Trump's assistants are trying to avoid escalation with allied countries, whether in Europe or in the Middle East, and therefore they seek to reduce the importance of his statements, and consider it a ""slip of tongue"", to reassure the allies in the region, where the American administration realizes that it has interests and strategic partnerships that cannot Sacrifice it for non -calculated policies.

Al -Dabi notes that the Trump administration finds itself in an internal and international dilemma, as it faces an increasing opposition from within the United States itself, along with the international rejection of its policies, and this opposition comes from several sides, there are lobbies inside Washington calling for military escalation in the Middle East, while There are other parties that consider these policies not studied, and the United States may lead to unaccounted confrontations.

The dangers of demographic engineering that political Zionism seeks

Professor d. Jamal Harfoush, Professor of Scientific Research Curricula and Political Studies at the Center University Academic Research in Brazil, that the extensive international condemnation of Trump's plans on the displacement and occupation of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip reflects a clear legal and moral position against these proposals, which is a flagrant violation of international law and international agreements, foremost of which is the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 that prohibits forced deportation, and a charter Rome, which criminalizes displacement as a crime against humanity.

Harfoush notes that international condemnation is not just passing diplomatic statements, but rather documented legal certificates that confirm that the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza is a dangerous precedent that goes beyond the Palestinian dimension and threatens the entire international system.

Harfoush explains that these condemnation reflects an increasing awareness of the international community of the dangers of demographic engineering that political Zionism seeks, through unconditional American support, as Arab and Islamic countries, and with them many European powers, realize that allowing to pass such statements without a serious confrontation will lead to the consolidation of The approach of forced displacement as a political tool, which poses a threat to regional and international stability.

Harfoush asked: ""How can the world accept to deport millions The Palestinians, while previously rejected the displacement of Ukrainian refugees or Rohingya? "", Stressing that the double standards in dealing with forced displacement issues threaten the credibility of the international system, and weaken the ability of international institutions to impose respect for international law.

Harfosh confirms that the international condemnation of these statements can be a legal basis for diplomatic and judicial moves against Trump and its administration, and against Israel, which is the first beneficiary of this criminal vision.

Harfoush explains that these condemnations open the door to the possibility of prosecuting Trump, similar to what happened with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was issued an international arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court due to forced displacement, stressing that there are legal precedents that can be built on to provide similar cases against Trump.

Harfoush believes that these condemnation also strengthens the legal Palestinian position before the international courts, whether by submitting complaints before the International Court of Justice against the American administration, or to file lawsuits against Trump and its officials in the national courts of countries that have signed the Rome Charter.

Harfosh stresses that these condemnation must turn into practical tools to activate accountability International, and not to be satisfied with political and media positions.

Regarding Trump's attempts to alleviate his statements regarding the displacement of the Palestinians, Harfoush confirms that these tips are only a political maneuver aimed at reducing the severity of international reactions, without retracting the essence of the plan.

He explains that Trump has long relied on the method of ""media shock"", where he makes shocking statements, and then leaves his assistants the task of alleviating its severity, without denying its primary content, with the aim of achieving three main goals: testing international reactions, and introducing the idea in international political discourse, Public opinion works and converting focus on Israeli crimes.

Harfoush notes that Trump raises the idea of ??displacement and monitors how the international response will be, then leaves his assistants the task of ""clarification"", allowing them to measure the strength of international objections, and explore the weaknesses in the official positions of the major countries.

According to Harfoush, even if Trump's statements appear to be not implemented now, the mere presentation makes them part of the political debate, so that it turns from an idea rejected into a possible option in the future.

It indicates that this is what happened with the decision to transfer the American embassy to Jerusalem, which was rejected for decades and then became a reality because of the American insistence on imposing it.

Harfoush notes that instead of the debate on the crimes of the Israeli war in Gaza, it is transformed into a discussion on the ""how"" the implementation of the displacement, as if the displacement itself has become a Muslim matter, and the dispute only on the mechanisms of implementation.

Harfoush warns that Trump's tactical decline from the idea of ??sending American forces to Gaza may be a prelude to trying to pass a plan of displacement with other tools, such as encouraging Arab countries to receive large numbers of Palestinians under the cover of ""humanitarian aid"", or imposing enormous economic pressures on Gaza residents to force them On voluntary migration.

It is believed that this scenario requires a Palestinian, Arab and international alert to protect Gaza demographically and legally, and to prevent any attempt to turn the Palestinians into new refugees in the exile, indicating that the Israeli occupation sought on more than one occasion to export the internal crisis in Gaza by opening secret immigration channels, which is what must be Familiar to him.

Harfoush confirms that the Palestinian, Arab and international response should not be limited to rejecting these statements, but rather must go towards a diplomatic escalation And legal against any party that marketed these ideas, even before they turn into projects on the ground.

Harfosh stresses the need to file legal complaints against Trump and his allies, and to move lawsuits before international courts, just as the regulations that practiced forced displacement were dealt with in other regions of the world.

Harfosh confirms that what Trump is doing is not just passing statements, but rather is part of a media and political strategy aimed at reproducing a new catastrophe in a modern form, while trying to remove legal and moral immunity from the Palestinians.

Harfoush believes that the international condemnation of Trump's statements must turn into real pressure tools for Trump accountable and his allies, and to prevent the implementation of these plans under any name or excuse.

An indication of Washington's desire to fuel chaos in the region

The writer and political researcher d. Loyalties that the extensive international condemnation of the plans of US President Donald Trump on Gaza, including its control of the Strip and the displacement of its inhabitants, either permanently or temporarily, reflects a global awareness of the United States' exit from international legitimacy and its flagrant violation of international law.

Old women explain that these policies can be read as an indication of Washington's desire Future of chaos in the region, especially in light of its decline in its ability to stabilize its influence amid the rise of competitors such as China and Russia.

Old women indicate that Trump's withdrawal from the United Nations Human Rights Council, in addition to its controversial propositions such as the annexation of Canada and the control of the Panama Channel, confirms the United States’s orientation towards work outside the international legal framework, which threatens global stability.

Old women explain that these policies do not serve American interests in the long run, but rather increase the state of international turmoil, which may lead to adverse results that threaten US national security itself.

Old women assert that Washington's continued violation of international humanitarian law and ignoring diplomatic ethics enhances chaos and harms their international reputation, while seeking to impose their dominance, these policies push the competing forces to exploit the American moral and values ??to enhance their influence on the international scene.

Regarding Trump's proposals on Gaza, old women believe that his main goal is to obstruct the two -state solution and end the Palestinian issue, considering that his proposal to the reconstruction of Gaza after its occupation reflects the absence of a realistic and responsible vision at the international and Arab level To solve this issue.

""Where are the supporters of the Palestinian issue? What are their alternative proposals to confront Trump's plans?""

Old women assert that the most important questions are: Who will bear the responsibility for the reconstruction of Gaza? What are the repercussions of the implementation of this American plan on the future of the Palestinians? Stressing that the Trump administration does not care about the fate of the population, but rather seeks to impose its political agenda under the cover of reconstruction.

Old women explain that Trump's assistants did not deny his statements regarding the occupation of Gaza and the displacement of its residents, but rather tried to alleviate its severity, in an attempt to contain international anger, while realizing the size of the damage that may be caused to the United States in the event of its implementation.

Old women assert that Washington, despite its strength, cannot work outside the framework of the international community and international legitimacy, especially in light of the rise of competing forces that benefit from American mistakes to enhance its influence on the global scene.
Old women indicate the need for the urgent Arab and international action To confront this American proposition, stressing the importance of uniting the Palestinians about their national goals to face the risks that threaten their future.

Old women assert that dealing with Gaza must be through serious ideas and solutions that are in line with international legitimacy, and constitute a strong barrier in front of projects that aim to liquidate the Palestinian issue or undermine the rights of the Palestinian people.

An international consensus on rejecting the wild American policies

Journalist Dr. Mahmoud Al -Faroukh said that the angry international, Arab and Islamic reactions and rejecting the statements of US President Donald Trump about the displacement and occupation of the Gaza Strip's residents, a move that reflects an international consensus on rejecting the brutal American policies that see in the world only its interests and interests of its wife Israel.

Al -Farakh explains that these condemnations came to confirm the world's standing in the face of the American -Israeli project aimed at forcibly displacing the Palestinians from their land, which is the plan adopted by the extremist American right -wing with its Israeli right -wing counterpart.

Al -Farakh notes that Trump's statements about ""Gaza without its residents"" are an extension of an old Zionist settlement project that seeks to empty the land from its people, which is What Trump explicitly described the idea of ??""Gaza Riviera"", that is, the Gaza Strip is free of Palestinians and prepared for Israeli and Western investments.

Al -Farakh emphasizes that these condemnations are a strong blow to Trump, and a clear message that the world no longer accepts these racist policies that are trying to impose a new colonial reality in the region.

Al -Farakh stresses that Trump will not be able to impose his will on the Palestinians or the world as he pleases. The absolute American support for Israel will not pass without rejection, and the forced displacement that is planned will face a Palestinian, Arab and international solidity.

According to Al -Farakh, this great wave of global rejection prompted Trump's assistants to try to retract his statements, by providing reduced explanations that claim that he does not seek to occupy Gaza or send American forces to it, but these attempts cannot deceive anyone, Trump's statements were clear Immediately, it indicates its actual intentions towards Gaza and its people.

Al -Farakh notes that the Trump administration previously attempted to implement similar plans, such as the deal of the century, which sought to liquidate the Palestinian issue through projects aimed at localizing Palestinian refugees in other countries, and now Trump is repeated the scenario Himself, by trying to impose a new reality by forcing some Arab countries and Western countries to receive Palestinian refugees, in an attempt to end their presence in Gaza.

Al -Farakh believes that the American attempts to alleviate Trump's statements aim to absorb the growing global curse against these policies. The American administration realizes that there is an increasing international anger, and that global public opinion has begun to look at the United States as a partner in Israeli crimes against the Palestinians.

He points out that Trump's statements are not just a political opinion, but rather are part of an American -Israeli strategy aimed at testing Palestinian, Arab and international reactions, in order to prepare for the implementation of racist plans aimed at exterminating the Palestinian presence, then full control of the ground, which Al -Furkh described as not ""Deal of the Century"", but ""the slap of the century"".

Al -Farakh emphasizes that what is required now is not to be satisfied with condemnation, but rather to build on them through extensive political and diplomatic moves to obstruct the Trump plan, it is necessary that there be a unified Palestinian position, accompanied by strong Arab, Islamic and international moves, to confront any attempt to impose forced displacement on the residents of the sector Gaza.

Al -Farakh warns that the American -Israeli plans will not stop at Trump's statements, but will continue in various forms, which requires a rapid move to face these risks before they turn into a reality imposed.

Al -Farakh affirms that the Palestinians are not alone in this battle, as there is a wide global rejection of these plans, and it must be invested effectively in order to protect the rights of the Palestinians and prevent the implementation of any plans aimed at displacing them from their land.",PS

The Palestinians are the most people who adhere to their land and identity, and all Trump's chaos and Israeli plans for their displacement are closer to wishes than they are serious and applicable and will be confronted with repel There is Israel, the United States of America and many countries in the world.
This is not just emotional words, but there are historical facts and evidence confirming:
?-The Jewish Torah, despite the myths and lies surrounding them, is mentioned by the name (the Palestinians) many times, and these books recognize the existence of the Palestinian people and the battles that occurred between the Palestinians and the Hebrews.
?-British Foreign Minister Arthur Balfour promised the establishment of a homeland for the Jews in (Palestine) and did not mention the word Israel, which confirms the existence of a Palestinian people and entity at that stage.
?- The other minorities mentioned in the text of the Balfour Declaration (the Palestinians) are today the majority of the population of Palestine between the sea and the river.
?-after the First World War, the League of Nations was granted to Britain the right to assign to Palestine and this was the first international recognition of the existence of a state or entity A politician who has his well -known geography and borders.
?-The Palestinians ’connection with their homeland never was interrupted even when they were displaced in 1948, so the displaced people detonated the contemporary Palestinian revolution from the camps and places of asylum.
?-All international and regional organizations and the majority of the countries of the world recognize the existence of the Palestinian people and the PLO as a legal representative and the Palestinian state in the West Bank, Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.
?-When international organizations talk about the Palestinian people, which include in their statistics, the Palestinians of the interior and the Palestinians of the Diaspora, and their number today exceeds 15 million people.
?-During all Israeli Arab wars and aggressive practices from the occupation army and settlers and the siege, whether in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank, the numbers of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank are increasing steady and statistics of crossings or border outlets with Egypt and Jordan did not record any reverse migration and the returnees exceeded or equal to the departure, which confirms the adherence The Palestinian people in their homeland, especially in the Gaza Strip, who said it is not viable!
?-The Palestine Liberation Organization and the State of Palestine are the title of the Palestinian people, and all the Hamas movement expected from the conversion or political understandings with the enemy or other countries that do not obligate the people The Palestinian does not express his will because it is agreements between the occupying state and a party or a political movement that represents only itself.
??-All tramic and Israeli statements about the displacement of the Palestinians, especially from the Gaza Strip, despite its danger, but it is an attempt to distract attention and change the priorities of local and global interest, from Israel and its crimes and the international condemnation it is exposed to and the existential crisis it faces as a state of occupation and government even before the Flood of Al-Aqsa and the war Gaza must also turn Trump and his team the interest of global and American public opinion from problems and challenges Which will face them internally and internationally, it causes Trump's racism and his provocative policies with Europe and many countries of the world to transform attention from these problems and internal challenges to an interest in the Gaza Strip and the future of its population.
??-Trump's statements about the Gaza Strip and American politics in general cannot be separated, even during the Biden era, where the latter was silent on the crimes of the occupation and refused even to recognize that what is happening in Gaza is a war of genocide and ethnic cleansing and the dispute between administrators lies only in the method of implementing policies, where management Biden and his foreign minister Blinkkin is more vicious and wise than the Trump administration The most frank and foolish.
??-All of the above does not mean underestimating the seriousness of these statements and the tramic position, especially with our knowledge of its previous policies for Jerusalem and the Golan and the deal of the century and the freezing of UNRWA financing, and he may take advantage of the state of weakness and division in the Palestinian political system and in the Arab and international situation to pass some of his ideas, even by a limited rate.
??-The right-wing religious reference of the mentality and the thinking of Trump may push him to try to record a historical achievement for the Jewish people, and to enhance his financial and economic relations with Israel and the Jews of America.
??-We believe that what will fail the plans of the illusion of trauma is the Palestinian people and the Arab countries printed with Israel, especially Egypt and Jordan, and if these countries set their relations with Israel in the cuff and displacement of the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip on the other cuff and asked Washington and Tel Aviv the comparison between them, the American strategy will be placed in a real dilemma Because retracting normalization will fail all American policy in the region and even in the world.
??-The speed of Hamas's exit from the political and military scene in the Gaza Strip will be a catalyst in the failure of the ideas of displacement.",PS
"US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to establish a sovereign wealth fund next year, speaking about the possibility of purchasing the ""Tech Tok"" application and directed the Ministries of Trade and Treasury to submit a plan within 90 days.
It is expected that the establishment of the fund will be subject to approvals from Congress, as sovereign funds depend on the financial surpluses of countries while the United States suffers from a permanent deficit in its budgets.
""Other countries have sovereign wealth funds, which are much smaller, and they are not the United States,"" Trump told reporters after the signing.

The Americans and the Russians speak to each other again, while European leaders and diplomats contemplate the difficult options imposed by the American President, Donald Trump.
There is no doubt that Trump's diplomatic warning to Ukraine and America's allies in Western Europe may cause the Atlantic coalition to crack, perhaps to an irreplaceable extent.
It appears that Ukrainian President Volodimir Zellinski, is upset with the sudden change in the position issued by the White House, although some of his many critics at home say he should have expected it.
Trump had shown a long time before his victory in his re -election, that he would not continue the policies of Joe Biden.
On his arrival in Türkiye on his last trip, Zellinski expressed his regret that negotiations to end the war are ""in the absence of the main parties affected by the consequences of Russian aggression.""

In the process of crossing again to Corsak soon, to join the fighting in support of the lands that Ukraine seized from Russia.
As a condition to reach the Ukrainian soldiers, we agreed not to detect sites or identities accurately, except for saying that they are in the border areas around the city of Sumi, and all of this is part of the continuous fighting To Ukraine in Corsak.
In a small room in a hidden workshop in a village, there was a huge display of the deadly force of Ukrainian weapons on shelves made of panels from the wood factory standing stretched on wooden ammunition boxes.
Above these shelves there were hundreds of drones, Ukrainian -made. Each costs about $ 380.
The soldiers who were examining it before filling it in the cardboard boxes to send it to the fighting arenas in Kork said that when it is armed - and a skilled pilot - it can even destroy a tank.
One of them, Andrew, said, he was a pilot directed to drones until his leg exploded. He did not think much about what was said by the Americans, but none of them trusted President Vladimir Putin.
Their drones were destroyed a few hours ago a Russian armored unit advanced in broad daylight via a frozen field covered with snow. You have shown me the video. Some of the vehicles they struck raised the red flag of the Soviet Union instead of the Russian flag.
The city of Sumi is crowded enough during the day, as it opens stores and is filled with goods. But once dark, the streets become almost deserted. Alerts come Frequent air strikes.
Anti -aircraft guns firing in the sky for hours, targeting the waves of Russian running aircraft that cross the border near here to attack targets deep in Ukraine - and sometimes in Sumi itself.
In a large residential building, there were traces of a large hole in the building that penetrated three floors caused by a Russian drone attack two weeks ago or so, and 11 people were killed in the attack. Since then, the building has been evacuated as engineers have been afraid that it may be so severely damaged.
The building is part of a residential complex consisting of similar lumps built during the Soviet era. The residents who still live next to the devastating and insecure building were practicing their daily lives, walking to the stores or their cars, wrapped in heavy clothes to protect themselves from the severe cold.
McCola, a 50 -year -old man, stopped talking while walking to his home with his young son. He lives next to the building destroyed by the Russians.
I asked him about his opinion on Trump's idea of ??peace in Ukraine.
He said: “We need peace. It is necessary because there is no point in war. War does not lead to anything. If you look at The amount of lands occupied by Russia so far, the Russians will eventually reach Kiev, and they must continue to fight for 14 years. Only people are the ones who suffer. The war must end. ""
McCola believes that there will be no deal worthy of Putin and Trump sitting together without Zellinski and the Europeans.
Another neighbor of the building called Yulia, 33, was walking with her dog - Jack Russell - and said that she was at her home when the Russians attacked the neighboring residential building.
""All this happened shortly after midnight, when we were about to go to bed. We heard a strong explosion, and we saw a huge red flash through our window. We saw terror. It was very frightening.""
Yulia noted that ""many people were abroad. I remember that there was a woman walking on the street - and she was screaming for help - we could not see her as soon as the explosion occurred, but in the end she was rescued from the rubble.""
Peace is possible, as you think, ""but they need to stop bombing first. There will be peace except when they stop doing it. They must come from their side because they are the ones who started this terror.""
""Of course, no You can trust Putin. ""
With the disappearance of the last sunlight, Boris, the 70 -year -old retired colonel, stopped, who served for more than 30 years in the Soviet army, and was on his way to his car. He said that his son and grandson wearing military uniforms and fighting for Ukraine.
""Peace is possible, but I do not really believe in it. I think justice will prevail for Ukraine. We must be careful,"" he added.
""As long as Putin exists, you cannot trust the Russians. Because they believe in it as a religion. You will not change them. It takes time,"" Boris said.
I asked him: So what is the solution - to continue fighting or a peace agreement?
He replied, ""Ukraine needs to think of peace. But we should not surrender. I do not see any feasibility. We will resist until we become stronger. It seems that Europe is ready to help us. There is no point in surrender.""
Donald Trump, the man who seems convinced that the principles of the real estate deal to end the war will discover, will discover that peace -making is more complicated than just reaching the ceasefire and determining the amount of the land that each side keeps.
President Putin has clearly explained that he wanted to break the sovereignty of Ukraine and destroy its ability to work as an independent country.
Whether it is Ukrainian President Zellinski has a seat on the table of President Trump's conferences or not, he will not agree to this. If permanent peace, if possible, it will be a long and slow process.
If Trump wants a quick return from peace, he must search elsewhere.",UK

"US President Donald Trump's insistence on displacing part of the Palestinian people from the Gaza Strip, to reflect psychological behavior in ""I am wild"" in the man. The issue of ""I am brutal"" at Trump is referred to by the Danish behavioral psychologist Henrik Tinglef. It is not necessarily based on the competence of knowledge of a man and his supporters, as much as she tries to feed the swelling of I (Igo) individual and collective. Tinglif explained Trump's psychological in his attempt to extract Greenland from Denmark and Panama and the annexation of Canada, as it represents the ignorant and expansionist arrogance that owns the man, whose crew carefully chose to maintain his position as a remembrance of alpha in the herd.

Trump's proposal is the displacement of the Palestinians of Gaza, and based on what analyzes Tingleb, it indicates ignorance and arrogance, as it seems as if he ignores that all his country's ammunition, and the madness of the great power of the power of Zionism in the request and translation of genocide, did not lead them to another catastrophe. Trump's ""compassion"" on the people of Gaza, amid the ragness of arrogance and arrogance, did not advance him to curb the thirst for blood in Tel Aviv, nor to stop the removal of the Palestinian humanity and the shame from the public request to seek genocide and ethnic cleansing. Trump lifted settler terrorists from the sanctions list means that it is not Less submitted, no matter how arrogant, than the Zionist Joe Biden for the likes of Polish immigrants Benjamin Netanyahu and Ukrainian Btlael Smotrich, the Israeli extremist finance minister.

The arrogance of the ego monsters of Trump is not faced by submission, nor by accepting that he addresses states and peoples as if they are not sovereign, but rather the shock of rejection and alliance with European and American voices. The imposition of displacement is a war of war and ethnic cleansing. Before this and that, man and whisper consultants in his ear need to tell him about the meaning of the flood of the return of the Gazans to the northern Gaza Strip despite its destruction. Rather, his notification is that the displacement only means expanding the resistance act towards another geographical area. Perhaps Trump's embassies tell him about the realities of the ideas and proposals of the Arab streets and international solidarity with them in response, to reduce the crime committed against Palestine for 76 years. Trump can withdraw and resettle a million and a half million Israeli immigrants, in cooperation with Germany and France, especially from the double nationalities.

Yes, perhaps the adults on Gaza, who are ignorant of the perpetrators of the crime, consider that the proposal to transfer the Jews from Palestine is ""anti -Semitic"", and that is a real endorsement of the meaning of arrogance and acceptance of passing war and genocide crimes As long as blood is Palestinian and Arab. On the other hand, the responsibility of the Arab world is not in glorifying and steadfastness, but rather in the behavior on the basis that adhering to the land has a maintenance of the national security of the neighboring and long neighboring countries. The capable Arab countries have an opportunity to enhance the steadfastness of Gaza and the smile of their wounds, even by opening the doors for the employment and Gazan employees, similar to the Egyptian, the Syrian, the Lebanese, the Algerian, the Tunisian, the Sudanese and others. The reception of the workforce from Gaza will not make adherence to Palestine less for those who support his family and establish a life on the ruins of tremendous destruction. Starting on Earth is not done through verbal solidarity boxes.

Instead of confronting the projects of displacement with statements, and attempts to Judaize occupied Jerusalem are met, the Arab world can curb them with quick projects to rebuild the Gaza Strip and break the unjust siege. As for the behavior of the psychological behavioral obsession with Trump and its management in a fluent and gray language, this will not even protect the selfish national interests of the targeted countries. Ultimately, Trump is not an inevitable destiny that must be subjected to. Even in the language of interests, whoever loses the arrogance of the arrogant man is America and its interests, and she is the researcher of allies in Confronting the challenges of greatness related to its global location and future.",UK
"The failure of Israel to complete the full withdrawal from southern Lebanon, and its retaining with five points it considers a strategy in the heart of Lebanese territory, supervising the Lebanese regions and on the Israeli settlements at the same time, indicating a new old stage in the Israeli -military interaction with the presence of armed organizations hostile to it in southern Lebanon, and near Its northern settlements. Israel has a long experience with the security zone in the south, but the occupation of these strategic points is basically based on the lessons of the October 7 attack (2023), and its repercussions on the combat doctrine of the Israeli army, which has currently moved to the style of long wars against non -state armed organizations such as Hamas. And Hezbollah, and after the Israeli home front turned towards the primary goal of military confrontations.

Israel's insistence on controlling the five points in Lebanon is the largest excuse that Hezbollah can use to adhere to its weapon

Everyone who monitors the Israeli behavior, whether in the Gaza Strip or in Lebanon, must notice that the ceasefire agreements that Israel reached, whether with Lebanon or with ""Hamas"", does not mean or in any form to stop the operations in a way divorced. An agreement with Hamas is a temporary ceasefire, and with Lebanon there is an agreement with public and confidential understandings with the United States, which gives Israel the freedom to work in all Lebanese territory, to impose the agreement as the Israelis claim. If the ceasefire agreements do not mean that the war is stopped in Gaza, nor the stopping of Israeli attacks on Lebanon, then this means that Israel is the one that determines the rules of the game, in Gaza and Lebanon, and even in the Syrian Golan, and in all this it has the support and support of the American administration.
In fact, the principle of long wars is the result of the great shock left by the October 7 attack (2023), and the unprecedented Israeli military and intelligence failure, which was paid by this time civilians in Israel from the residents of the settlements near the border in the ""Gaza cover"", and the settlements in northern Israel And that Israel had to evacuate since the beginning of the war of support between Hezbollah and the Israeli army, on October 8 2023. But a deep change led to the attack in the awareness of the Israelis, regardless of their political affiliation, is the difficulty of continuing to live in this region safely without eliminating It is concluded with the armed organizations hostile to it, in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and in Lebanon. This constitutes a real dilemma that exceeds the two frameworks, military and political, and it deals with the essence of the possibility of Israel continuing to live in peace in this region, and this is partially interpreted by why the Israelis are considered ""October 7"" ""an existential threat"" to them, and how they undermined their confidence in the army, the state, institutions and destroying it.
What exacerbates this dilemma is that the 15 -month war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, or the Israeli war against Hezbollah in Lebanon, did not lead to decisive results such as the fact that the Israeli public awaits, and despite the painful strikes that Israel directed to the two organization, did not You spend a judgment based on them, neither militarily nor civilian, and she did not provide a categorical response to the deep upright anxiety over their security.
In light of this reality, the military leadership and politics in Israel is trying to compensate for its inability to achieve ""absolute victory"", by exploiting the ceasefire and security arrangements in order to continue this war in various ways and methods, which opens the door to the two -way to the permanent and continuous war era . on the one hand Others, the dilemma that Israel faces in how to deal with Hamas or Hezbollah is also the one who made it, and its current behavior increases and exacerbates it. The Israeli position rejecting any role of the Palestinian Authority in managing the Shoes of Gaza hinders any possibility to establish an alternative to the ""Hamas"" authority. This also applies to dealing with Hezbollah's weapon in Lebanon. Israel's insistence on controlling the five points in Lebanon, and refused to complete its withdrawal on the appointed date for it the largest pretext that Hezbollah can use to adhere to its weapon, and thwart any attempt by Lebanese rule to disarm God, as Israel continues to occupy Lebanese lands.

Any wrong decision that Hezbollah makes at this stage will not put it alone in the circle of danger, but rather Lebanon

Israeli treatment of Hezbollah's disarmament is based on a wrong understanding of the Lebanese reality, its complex structure, and the implications of the past war on Hezbollah and the resistance audience in Lebanon. Lebanon, with its social, economic, educational, media and religious infrastructure, was exploited The weakness and disintegration of the Lebanese state as a result of the Israeli wars and the Israeli occupations in order to turn a ""state within the state."" Despite all geopolitical changes that have recently occurred in the countries of the region, the axis of the resistance led by Iran due to the fall of the Assad regime, and the great loss that Hezbollah suffered, the phenomenon of Hezbollah is more rooted in the Lebanese Shiite environment. It is difficult for Israel to succeed in breaking the party by continuing to occupy areas of Lebanon in this way. The only thing that will result in this weakening the authority and prestige of the state, and put it under test in the face of the continuation of the occupation.
Hezbollah has a dangerous turn and difficult options, and any wrong decision it makes at this stage will not only put it in the circle of danger, but all of Lebanon.

With US President Donald Trump entering the White House, many files belonging to the façade as part of Washington's relationship with the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. Note that the weight of the Gulf states in Trump's first state is not the same today because of some of them, especially Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE, to impose themselves on the regional and international arenas in files with extremely important strategic dimensions.
What are the most prominent files that he must deal with regarding the Gulf Cooperation Council countries?
Saudi Arabia and Iran Agreement: Look for peace, even in China!
The normalization file is on the throne of the priorities of the Trump administration, which was distinguished by its previous era by concluding two normalization agreements regarding the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, within the framework of what was called ""Abrahamic agreements."" The first between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and the second between Israel and the Kingdom of Bahrain in September 2020 at the White House.

But Al -Ain today is on Saudi Arabia, especially since the file of the Israeli -Saudi normalization was cooked over low heat during the era of his predecessor Joe Biden, but the cooking was not equal for several reasons, including the war between Hamas and Israel, and also linking normalization to the defensive agreement that Riyadh wants to conclude with Washington.
The war between Hamas and Israel, following the events of October 7, delayed normalization talks that were underway under American sponsorship. This coincided with an Israeli rejection of the Saudi police to achieve normalization, which is the two -state solution.

Saudi Arabia rejected any normalization with Israel unless Israel recognized the Palestinians in an independent state, in turn delayed the conclusion of Riyadh and Washington, a defensive agreement whose broad lines were set without seeing the light, not to mention that it is an agreement that is not unanimous in the American corridors because of the opponents of his opponents that Israel monopolize military excellence In the Middle East region and that the defensive agreement be conditional on an agreement to normalize with Israel guarantee The last security in the region.
Consequently, without the Israeli -Saudi normalization, the agreement is likely to lack political support in the American Congress for approval.
And based on here, it is not possible to manage The American is alone in concluding the defensive agreement with Riyadh, as its conclusion requires its approval by a two -thirds majority in the US Congress. Without that approval, there will be no guarantee of an American commitment to this agreement. This happened with the nuclear agreement with Iran, which was concluded by former US President Barack Obama in 2015 without receiving the support of Congress at the time, from which President Donald Trump withdrew in 2018.
Trump calls Qatar to end its ""financing for terrorism""
The former US State Department adviser and member of the Republican Party Hazem Al -Ghobra, Trump expected the importance of normalization talks because he will change the life of everyone in the East for the better, expressing an interview with the BBC about his regret that former US President Joe Biden was unable to achieve this.
In turn, Abdullah Baaboud, the Omani academic specialized in international relations, Gulf affairs and the Middle East, considered that the Gulf and Arab countries are not against normalization with Israel, and the evidence, according to his opinion, lies in the Arab Peace Initiative approved at the Beirut Arab Summit in 2002 and which explicitly calls for normalization with Israel has specific conditions The forefront is the two -state solution.
Daboud expected during his speech with the BBC to meet Trump's pressure to Saudi Arabia with normalization with Israel, by raising Riyadh the ceiling of its demands to Washington. Among the most prominent of these demands, according to Baaboud estimates, the defense agreement and the peaceful nuclear program.
However, this tide and the islands will complicate the path of Israeli -Saudi normalization, according to the Omani academic.

In addition to the above, the Iranian file comes with its nuclear dimensions as a file no less important than the issue of normalization. Understanding Iran's influence in the region and its allied powers, not only a desire of Gulf dimensions for the Trump administration, which intends to end what he calls ""nuclear Iran"", the first day of its mandate, in conjunction with the return of Iranian -European negotiations in this regard. Note that the relationship between Tehran and some Gulf capitals took a positive approach.
According to the reading of the academic Abdullah Baaboud, it is likely that Iran focuses on its internal affairs in light of what he described as an Israeli and Western desire to destabilize and excite the Iranian interior. He believed that Iran should reduce its previous policy based on relying on its allies and imposing its hegemony, especially in the wake of what happened with Hamas in Gaza, and with Hezbollah in Lebanon and with the Assad regime in Syria.
Iran was expected to respond to Trump's pressure, by turning its nuclear program into a military program. This is something that the Gulf states, in advance, are Riyadh, which previously confirmed by the Prime Minister of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that his country will develop a nuclear weapon if Iran does so.
From here, Baaboud saw that it is in the interest of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries to reduce the American -Iranian congestion because this would protect the region from future conflicts.
While the American -Qatari relationship during the Trump era was characterized by a lot of tension, especially with the Gulf boycott of Qatar, Qatar was able to extract the title of ""strategic ally of Washington from outside NATO"" during the President's era. Previous Joe Biden.

Trump, who is returning to the White House, is returning with a different vision towards the small Gulf capital in the area, but the actors in its external diplomacy, in light of its endeavor in recent years to impose itself as international mediation in barbed files such as the Russian -Russian file and the war between Israel and Hamas, so Qatar today is not like yesterday's country.
In this context, the former adviser to the US State Department and a member of the Republican Party, Hazem Al -Ghobra, expected that the next stage will witness a serious dialogue between Washington and Doha, setting the foundations of a new relationship that suits the new Qatari role.
Al -Ghobra said: ""There are great criticisms in the American interior of the Qatari political and media role after the events of October 7, so I expect that there will be a direct dialogue between Washington and Doha that results in a consistency between the two parties and establishes the relationship between them.""
As for Baaboud, he ruled out that the Trump administration will retract the classification of the previous administration of Qatar as a strategic ally for it due to the prominent Qatari roles in regional files sensitive in advance of the war between Hamas and Israel. In his opinion, Qatar was able to play a mediation role that led to the end of a war that lasted more than fifteen A month, in addition to its upcoming role in Syria under the new political administration.
Many files for the Trump administration to deal with it in the Gulf, but the most difficult, in the opinion of many, lies in the opinion of many, in its inability to limit the Russian Gulf and the Chinese Gulf openness, which was built on solid economic foundations.
This comes at a time when the Gulf states consider that the former Trump administration ""failed"" the Gulf when it did not defend Riyadh after its facility in Aramco was attacked. ""The Saudis should defend themselves because I do not want to fight a war with Iran,"" President Trump said frankly.
Another station that the Gulf states see that Washington has shown as an ally that is not counting on, and when the American forces withdrew from Afghanistan, leaving their allies there during the era of former President Joe Biden. These Gulf states considered that the American withdrawal from Afghanistan is a clear indication of not relying on the United States of America to protect their security.
Abdullah Baaboud, the Omani academic, specialized in international relations, Gulf affairs and the Middle East, described the Chinese Gulf relationship as a dilemma for Trump. This is because the Gulf states depend, according to his appreciation, on China, in exporting oil and gas more than its dependence on the West. This in his opinion, the Gulf economy is a security and economically linked to the Chinese and Asian economy. Aboud expected that the current US administration would pressure the Gulf capitals so that strategic agreements with Beijing affect the security of the Middle East.
As for Trump's dealings with the human rights file in the Gulf Cooperation Council states, observers believe that the matter will not differ from what it was in his previous term when he did not give great importance to this file, the common interests do not make this file a priority for him. And that is, unlike what happened during the state of Biden, whose beginnings were distinguished by sending harsh criticism to Saudi Arabia because of its human rights record, but these criticisms have led with Saudi Arabia the emergence of a global power in the field of energy in the aftermath of the Russian -Ukrainian war, when it had the final word to control in Annual oil production within the framework of the OPEC Plus group.",UK

The idea and project of the Palestinian state was not exposed to existential challenges and strategic risks as it is exposed to these days, nor did the Arab countries face existential challenges as it is at this stage, but these challenges may be an opportunity to unite the Palestinians by coordinating the positions of all the resistance factions with the organization after cleaning the organization from Its cadres are expired, and the American and Israeli statements aimed at the Palestinian presence and Arab security are a valuable opportunity For the rapprochement of Arab countries and the coordination of their positions and the positions of Islamic countries with the African group and the Latin group economically, politically, security and military and the Brexes Group as an economic and international political axis and a global military defensive, in an end and competition for all international axes and alliances with openness and rapprochement with the Russian and Chinese axes, as it is an opportunity to structure the League of Arab States, and change its system And clean it from Its cadres and the entry of the university are the circle of action instead of being satisfied with the reactions.
It is time to adopt and rehabilitate the Arab national security strategy, the joint Arab defense strategy, and the lack of waiting for Netanyahu and the White House to destroy our Arab countries and their peoples, one after another, awaiting American mercy and humanity. The time is still in our hands as Arab, Islamic and friendly countries, to form a deterrent alliance of Western imperialism and renewed ancient colonialism, and this is confirmed by the courageous Arab reactions against the statements of the American -Israeli -Israeli displacement and displacement against Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.
Arabs, Muslims and Africans must realize that the usurping entity in Palestine is the old, renewed, colonial, colonial cord For the Arab region and Africa, it is time to uproot it completely, because this entity is not subject to human and moral rehabilitation and is not coexist with any natural human group and it must be fully supplemented outside the Arab region, and these people can only understand the language of war based on the American, British, French partner, and the rest European colonists.",SA
"The Director General of the ""Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies"" warned Azmi Bisharan that President Princeonald Tremblin, the displacement of the Palestinians, may become realistic even though it is not an inevitable destiny, and that the response to it is by making the Gaza Strip fit to live. While he said that what makes Trump's words seriously is the weakness of the Arab nation, he warned that the American president will not stop until he issued a practical Arab response, expressing his confidence that the American -Israeli loyalty to the Arabs today is the result of their position on the Gaza war. As for Syria and its transitional phase, Bishara has assured that the sufficient equal citizenship in Syria is the need for the slogan of protection of minorities, and it seemed not sure that the Syrians were heading to a liberal democratic system that is openly with its fear of freedoms in it.

Azmi Bishara: Trump will not stop until a practical Arab response is issued
Bishara, in a special interview with Al -Arabi TV on Sunday evening from the city of Lusail in the State of Qatar, said that we are forced to deal with Trump's proposals seriously since he is the president of the United States of America, regardless of his intellectual level and information He possesses, his interests, whores and personality. He described Trump's ideas regarding the displacement of the Palestinians as a very and bad provocative. Although it is not an application program yet, as evidence that its owner had answers to the questions about his project, but the Arab thinker warned that this group of ideas may turn into a plan as the Israelis do now, it was the one who awakened Trump's statement with their memory with the transcript that they practiced twice For the Palestinians, in 1948 and 1967, recalling that 72% of the Israelis supported Trump's idea of ??the Palestinians. In Gaza.

Arab Marshall plan for Gaza
On this topic, the author of the book ""Trump's Deal - Netanyahu"" reminded: the way to the text, and from it to answer the question: What is the work? The Arab position speaking on the Gaza war or complicity with it pending that Israel will eliminate the Palestinian resistance, in the opinion of Bishara, ""the infrastructure on which Trump's statement was issued"", which gains his seriousness from the state of humiliation that the Arab nation suffers from. On that, Bishara said that it was not like this The statement (Trump's idea of ??displacement of the Palestinians) would be issued without the observation of US officials to our Arab behavior in the war on Gaza, and the officials of Arab countries have turned into something similar to the observers of what is happening in the Strip.

The director of the ""Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies"" concluded that Trump will not stop until a practical Arab response is to be issued, which is the reconstruction of Gaza and the promotion of the steadfastness of the Palestinians by opening the borders of the sector with Egypt, not to emigrate, but to introduce what is necessary to live without waiting for Israel's permission. And Egypt, the Great State, ""does not need permission to enter caravans and tents to Gaza,"" according to Bishara, who asserted that Israel will not announce a war on it for this reason. Bechara found that the Arab summit scheduled for February 27 in Cairo may be a historical opportunity to change the view of the Arab public opinion of Arab summits as in vain.

He went to Arab officials by saying that the response at the Arab summit, which may later become a summit An Arab Islamic joint, must be with decisions that make the Gaza Strip to live, and to develop and implement an Arab Marshal Marshal plan for Gaza. Moreover, the owner of ""on the Arab Question: Introduction to an Arab Democrat"", seemed decisive in his appreciation that the Arab and Islamic Summit is able to force the Palestinians to unity and rearrange the Palestine Liberation Organization, not conducting mediation between the two main Palestinian parties. He concluded his idea about this matter by warning that under these circumstances, if the Palestinian forces do not unite, this means that there is no light at the end of the tunnel.
Stopping the assignment of the Arab initiative
In response to a question about the words of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in which he asks those who reject the idea of ??Trump to present their alternatives, Bishara replied that the Arabs have submitted their project since 2002 through the Arab Peace Initiative in Beirut (a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders, the return of refugees and the withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights In exchange for the recognition and normalization of relations between Arab countries and Israel), and they began to abandon them with free normalization with Israel. He pointed out that the solution does not lie in the abdication of the Arab initiative, but rather by stopping the waiver of it through normalization Free.

As for the possibility that Trump's ideas of the displacement of the Palestinians will lead to the return of the Israeli war on Gaza, he excluded Bechara, and pointed out that Trump does not want to return to the war because he knows that its military targets have exhausted. As for fears of the arrival of the displacement train from Gaza to the West Bank, the writer ""From the Jewish of the State to Sharon"" explained that since 1967 and migration are accelerating in the West Bank, but steadfastness is there. However, for Jordan, this is a strategic topic, and the Kingdom may close the borders because of it. He described the worst thing that happens in the West Bank as impossible to transmit the Palestinian state by moving from the fact that the settlements are cantons in the West Bank, to making the places of the Palestinians housing cantons in their land and turning their lives into hell by restricting, displacement and barriers.
Syria and the transitional stage
In the second part of the Bechara dialogue with Al -Arabi TV, especially in Syria, and in its transition Elections before the state settled and before agreeing on the constitution, calling for preaching from the Libyan experience before us. And he believed that there is no meaning for anything that happens in Syria if he does not keep freedoms and rights by the transitional ruling and later in the constitutional declaration. Even Bechara expressed expressed his fear of the reality of freedoms and rights in Syria, especially in the stage in which the state is strengthened. He said: ""I am not sure that the Syrians are heading to a liberal democratic system.""

On his expectations and information about the transitional stage procedures, the writer of the ""sect, sectarianism, imagined sects"" suggested that a pluralistic government emphasize the idea of ??equal citizenship and the rule of law. He explained that the equal citizenship is the one that nullifies the need for the slogan ""Protecting minorities"", and also stressed the need for a legislative body that sets a temporary constitutional declaration. According to what Bishara sees, the transitional phase in Syria must start with a clear legal procedure for establishing the transitional justice and courts exclusively punished for the major crimes committed by the regime, and settlements are made And reconciliations and do not establish a desire for revenge, according to the expression of the writer ""democratic transition and its problems: a comparative theoretical and practical study."" In this context, he advised to distinguish between the system on the one hand, and the state and its bureaucracy necessary for the survival of institutions on the other hand, which the regime destroyed many of them. The Arab thinker stopped at the army, whose solution was not a correct decision, but he continued that this remedying this quickly building a new army is very important.

Bechara lamented the suffering of the Syrian people for a long time from the worship of the personalities, so he suggested that the fanaticism not transfer from one person to another, describing President Ahmed Al -Sharaa as the charismatic personality and the primary role in the face of ""ISIS"" and the Idlib administration and the decision to crawl to Damascus, and this is in the terms of Bishara, which is estimated ""but Everything else is negotiable. "" The director of the ""Arab Center"" expressed his confidence that the world wants the transitional experience in Syria to succeed towards a stable state, but ""Israel is really concerned By dividing Syria and extending lines towards population groups to have influence in its circles.",UK
"After the previous Biden administration was involved in partnership with Israel in the implementation of genocide and ethnic uprooting against our people, today the United States is witnessing an institutional coup that will be more involved in the hostility of the rights of our people led by Donald Trump with the help of billionaire Elon Musk, who has already become the second man in the American administration. This coup is not limited to the restructuring of the White House, but extends to the control of vital ministries such as the Treasury, the Usaid Development Agency, the CIA and the Public Services Management, which gives Trump unprecedented influence that enables it to restructure institutions, in a way that serves his most extreme populist agenda. This transformation is directly reflected in the Middle East, especially with regard to our national cause, as it supports forced displacement policies, provides political and financial cover to expand settlement and Israeli annexation, and works to undermine international laws that hinder the implementation of these policies.

What Trump and Mask are doing is not just an administrative change, but rather an unconventional coup aimed at imposing the fascist right -wing agendas, as Mask, who performed the Nazi greeting on the day of inauguration, became a major player in re - Forming the deep state according to Trump's vision. Political cleansing operations within institutions not only targeted opponents, but were also driven by extreme Zionist and Episide agendas that believe in ""divine instructions"" and ""the biblical right"". This enables the new administration to redirect federal funds to support projects related to Israel, especially in settlement expansion and annexation, and financing major capital companies as an alternative to governments, in a way that enhances the control of conservative capitalist thought that is globally wild that wants to end even liberal trends around the world and the West in particular through its right -wing vision Populist. American institutions have also been unloaded from any resistance to Trump's foreign policies, especially towards the Middle East, and to give Israel a legal and political cover for the practices of annexation, forced displacement, economic and digital technology.

However, this transformation cannot be understood without referring to the role that the Zionist billionaire Miriam Admion, who was one of the largest financiers of Trump's election campaign, and a major partner in promoting Israel's expansion policies. Its support was not just electoral financing, but a strategic investment to achieve goals such as The American embassy was transferred to Jerusalem, the closure of the Palestine Liberation Organization office, the drying sources of the Palestinian financing internationally, and now the imposition of sanctions on UNRWA and the International Criminal Court and the enabling Israel to fully seize the West Bank and try to impose displacement plans from Gaza and refugee camps after the extermination of the extermination that has not yet ended If it is possible to find ""renewable authorities"" according to the American concept in Gaza.

Political appointments in the Trump administration also played a crucial role in devoting these trends in addition to devoting the policy of isolation and withdrawal from international organizations and agreements. The administration included personalities such as Mike Hajabi, who promotes the idea that Palestine is a ""biblical Jewish land"" and Richard Greenil, who is pushing to impose more striking American policies in supporting Israel, and Nikki Haley, who led campaigns against any decisions that condemn Israel internationally, in addition to the defense and foreign ministers And to ambassadors and other officials working to implement these policies, the most recent of which was the insolence of Ortigos, Trump's representative yesterday By interfering with internal affairs during her visit to Lebanon and trying to impose its requirements.
And with Trump's tools escalating the institutions The American, talking about the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank has become not just a passing threat, but rather a plan under implementation that includes imposing an absolute economic and military blockade to push the Palestinian people to search for the ""option of escape"", and to facilitate the displacement of the residents of the sector and refugee camps to the Sinai under the cover ""human solutions Or to areas near Jericho, as some Israeli media sources indicated yesterday, north of the Iraqi -Iraqi border, or even the new southern Syria, after the Islamist invasion. The pressure of the American administration succeeded. The Arab countries are also pressured by various means to accept this displacement as part of a larger deal to normalize with Israel, in exchange for economic and security incentives and promises, or by imposing new facts through the so -called ""renewable authorities"" as it happens in Syria and Lebanon, with the aim of accelerating the implementation of a vision "" The new Middle East ""that serves American and Israeli interests at the expense of the peoples of the region.

The absolute control of Trump and Mask, and their department means that the United States will not exert any pressure on Israel regarding the rights of our Palestinian people, even those that were among the false American promises regarding the ""two -state solution"" and ""the state of cheese The Swiss ""as President Abu Mazen, who appeared in the deal of the century with geographical assistants without Jerusalem. On the contrary, all the current policies are designed to enable Israel to implement its colonial expansion agendas, with full American, political, military and financial support, in a broader context of ethnic cleansing and acquisition policies The capabilities of the region, including energy, gas, commercial and sea corridors.

This transformation is implemented calmly and accelerated, without the need for a military coup or declaring a state of emergency, which makes any internal resistance that has almost impossible or difficult to the minimum, as legal and institutional control tools have been neutralized. Its influence goes beyond the United States to broader policies that include directing financial and political support in accordance with Trump's goals even in Europe as well, which enhances attempts to continue to impose a unipolar global system with a new garment based on the logic of right -wing, conservative, conservative and ultimate colonial domination.

Trump's policies will not be fully random or improvised, but will depend on their compatibility with the interests of powerful forces in the United States or the so -called deep state. And if it contradicts With it clearly and seriously, we may witness an internal clash between the wings and components of the American Authority. But my humble belief that at the present time, it seems that these forces see in Trump a tool to achieve their project and not a threat to it.

What is happening in Washington is not just a political crisis or an internal conflict, nor is it as some have gone to interpret it according to the psychological diagnoses of Trump's sick personality or his dependence on the principle of demanding a lot to get a little. Rather, a radical reconstruction of America's role in the world, so that it becomes a major partner in white racial superiority projects, ethnic cleansing and colonial settlement, under the guise of ""real estate deals"" that Trump talks about, but in essence it reflects the neosra of neoliberal thought and trying to defeat the emerging and progressive powers in the world and even liberalism From it.

If there is no serious international, Arab and Palestinian action to confront these policies according to clear and well -known requirements and entitlements, then ethnic cleansing and attempts to threaten international peace and security will become a frightening inevitable reality. However, Trump's projects and a mask bearing my belief in the folds of their failure, and threaten American internal stability itself, Which may lead to internal disintegration and unexpected conflicts in the future. Trump's directions and vision will not and you will not find a welcome between the Palestinian people, of course, nor among all the peoples of the earth, even the American people themselves, who will be the first to pay for them.",PS
"On Thursday, Israel instructed its army to prepare ""a plan that allows any inhabitant in Sector who wants to leave to do so, to any country that he wishes to receive.""
According to Defense Minister Yisrael Katz, ""The plan will include options to get out of the wild crossings, in addition to special arrangements to leave across the sea and the air.""
Israel has begun to develop a plan to facilitate the ""voluntary departure"" of the Gaza population, while President, American, Trump, has repeated the judge that his country would control the Palestinian sector after its inhabitants were deported despite the broad booing of this proposal.
As soon as Israel announced on Thursday morning its intention to facilitate the departure of the Gazans to the sector, the movement was quick to call for an emergency Arab summit to confront the Trump project ""Al -Tujiri"", while Egypt warned of the repercussions of these developments on the fragile truce in the sector.
The residents of Gaza are not currently able to leave the Israeli blockade of an Israeli siege that is largely destroyed by the war between the Hebrew state and Hamas, which erupted after the movement's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. A truce that entered into force on January 19.
Trump released Tuesday during his reception at the White House, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a strange and unprecedented idea that the United States will control Gaza with the aim of its reconstruction and development economically after the inhabitants of the Strip deported Egypt and Jordan, who rushed to reject this idea, similar to what the Palestinians themselves and several countries around the world did.
On Wednesday, US administration officials tried to alleviate this idea, as White House spokeswoman Caroline Levit said that Trump ""did not pledge to deploy forces on the ground in Gaza"" at least ""at the present time"", while US Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that the Republican president wanted to leave The Palestinians are temporarily, while Washington is rebuilding.
However, Trump returned Thursday to confirm his seriousness, stressing that ""the United States will receive from Israel the Gaza Strip after the fighting ends"" and that ""American soldiers will not be needed"" to implement this idea.
The Republican billionaire on his social communication platform, Truth Suushle, added that the Palestinians of the Strip will be abandoned until ""they will be resettled in more secure and beautiful societies, with new and modern homes in the region.""
But Hamas saw in Trump's statements a ""declared will to occupy the Gaza Strip"", Claiming an urgent Arab summit ""to confront the displacement project.""
""Trump's statements are definitely rejected, Gaza for its people and will not leave it,"" said Palestinian movement spokesman Hazem Qassem.
He added that the movement ""is calling for an emergency Arab summit to confront the displacement project"" and ""to address Trump's pressure and stability on its positions that refuse to displace.""
In turn, Cairo warned that the Israeli government's support for Trump's proposal may ""weaken the ceasefire agreement and eliminate it (...) and incite the return of the fighting"" between Israel and Hamas.
In a statement, the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Cairo ""rejects any proposal or visualization aimed at liquidating the Palestinian issue through displacement,"" warning of the dangers of this ""on the entire region and on the basis of peace.""
She added that Cairo ""completely rejects any proposal or perception"" based on ""the displacement of the Palestinian people from its historical land and its seizure, whether in a phased or final manner,"" stressing that ""Egypt will not be a party to it.""
According to Vanam Chitai, a professor of international law at the Higher Institute for International and Development Studies in Geneva, it is ""it is not realistic to imagine that this large number of people"", that is, more than two million Palestinians living in a sector Gaza, ""they will leave of their own free will. If they do so, it will inevitably be under coercion, whether direct or indirect.""
In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday evening, Netanyahu described Trump's idea as ""wonderful"" and said that it should be ""studied ... and implemented.""
He pointed out that the initiative does not necessarily mean that the Palestinians will leave the sector permanently.
His extreme right -wing ally, Minister of Finance, welcomed Salail Smotrich, Thursday, with the army's readiness to ""play its role in the"" Gaza population ""migration plan to the host countries.
The Secretary -General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, stressed ""the necessity of avoiding any form of ethnic cleansing,"" recalling ""the right of the Palestinians to simply live as human beings on their land.""
While Trump also said that he wanted to make the Palestinian sector ""Riviera Middle East"", the White House explained that the United States will not finance ""the reconstruction of Gaza"", but it will work in this direction with its ""partners in the region.""
French President Emmanuel Macron and Egyptian Abdel Fattah El -Sisi warned that ""any forced displacement of the Palestinian people in Gaza or the West Bank will be unacceptable.""
Jordan, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and the League of Arab States rejected the American plan, as well as European Union.
For its part, Iran considered Thursday that the ""forced displacement"" of the residents of Gaza was ""shocking.""
Thursday, the US Secretary of State said that the countries that criticize Trump's proposal in the matter of Gaza should initiate proposals to help the besieged and destroyed sector.
""There are countries in the region that express great concern. We encourage these countries to progress and find a solution and answer to this problem,"" he added.

"In colonial logic, national geography becomes a moving boundary that can be displaced and changed in accordance with the understandings of the division of resource areas or the settlements of the conflict foci management, which are based on the displacement of the original peoples from their countries and confiscating their right to self -determination. The colonial logic itself is renewed at every historical stage depending on the international and regional variables, so the American administration directed its diplomacy and political resources to reformulate the Middle East region, towards the ""New Middle East"", starting from the Palestinian gate, by imposing the future scenario of the Gaza Strip, and requires displacement The Palestinians from their land as a condition for stabilizing in the region.
The American -Israeli colonial policy is similar to its occupation and expansionary dimensions by imposing the representatives of power, and its use in moving the geographical borders at the expense of the national borders of sovereign countries, as well as at the expense of the indigenous population, by using multiple pressure papers in the head of the military force. In this context, the alliance, which serves the domination policies, the administration of US President Donald Trump has turned an active tool to accelerate its occupation ally plans in Palestine, by imposing a strategy that aims to dismantle the Palestinian issue and evacuate the Palestinians from their historical land, in addition to unconditional military and political support, which allowed Israel to proceed with the use of force against the Palestinians, and ignore its military escalation in the West Bank camp, the Trump administration adopted the policy of forced displacement In the right of the Palestinians, by supporting the settlement approach in the West Bank cities, from lifting the sanctions against The settlers involved in violations against the Palestinians, to enable the Israeli government to expand the building of settlements, and thus devote the expansion of the Israeli entity state in the West Bank, in exchange for the bulldozing and surveying of the Palestinian Authority, while the strategy of managing the future of the Gaza Strip post -truce is the second rib in the policy of dismantling Palestine historical. And liquidating the Palestinian issue, besides linking the state of violence in the Strip to the survival of the Palestinians in Gaza, not By the Israeli entity war, the Trump administration requires stopping violence and establishing security in Gaza, as well American - Israeli to anticipate the arrangements for the second stage of the armistice agreement in Gaza, by preparing the regional and international political climate for the displacement of the people of Gaza and the purification of the region, in addition to building on the state of ceasefire to impose a fait accompli that may lead to confirming the path of evacuation of Gaza in the long run, as well as moving papers Pressure on neighboring countries to accept the proposal to receive the Palestinians, in addition to converting reconstruction a political and social pressure paper that may It leads to the immigration of the Palestinians voluntarily from the Strip.

Dismantling of historical Palestine, and liquidating the issue, crystallizing a long -term strategy showing its indicators in Trump's policy towards Palestine

The dismantling of historical Palestine and the liquidation of the Palestinian issue, they require a long -term strategy, but its indicators appear in the Trump administration policy towards Palestine at the present time, by using the truce of the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, and security arrangements are factors that can be built to strip the Hamas movement from returning to The authority, and created a new equation on the ground. Before moving to the second stage of the armistice agreement, the American administration began intensifying Its presence indirectly by recruiting Private security companies that oversee the management of the ports and the recruitment of former American soldiers to do so, and the mission of the American security companies in the sector may turn from monitoring the human movement in the outlets to a military mission, taking advantage of the state of security vacuum for the authority to arrange a form of a permanent American presence, which of course serves the state of the Israeli entity. This is equivalent to the recent opening of the Rafah port and assuming a security force of the European Union to supervise the port, meaning a return to the pre -Hamas control of power in the sector, and to impose a new reality before any political understandings to manage the future of Gaza. Although the American administration requires (as an Israeli ally) the reconstruction of Gaza to take over a local authority other than Hamas, or an international and regional security force, it seeks to invest the reconstruction a political pressure paper on ""Hamas"", which may lead to beating its popular incubator, as the stabilization of the case The destruction in Gaza, and the transfer of the reconstruction file is a long -term bargaining paper, from linking the reconstruction file to the authority that In the future, it will be agreed to disperse any regional consensual endeavor in this regard, which makes Hamas in front of social and popular pressure to hold it responsible Normalization of daily life, besides that, the disruption of the reconstruction project, and its linking to the Palestinian internal political situation develops the competitive situation between ""Hamas"" and the Palestinian Authority, including the struggle for the Gaza administration, and in the absence of a unified Palestinian project, and a vision of the future of the sector, may lead To exclude them from any active role in the next stage, in exchange for the monopoly of the American administration and its Israeli ally, the management of the future of the sector, and the imposition Their recruitment, whether it is towards dividing the sector into security areas or the displacement of the Palestinians from Gaza.
The dilemma of the Reconstruction of the Gaza Strip and its complexity is accompanied by the contents of the policies of displacement of citizens at the present time or in the long run, and although the reconstruction of Gaza may require a long time, compared to the state of general destruction due to the Israeli war, the daily reality in the sector requires humanity and morally to suspend the conditions Politics for the Reconstruction of Gaza, by starting to rehabilitate service structures and population facilities at least Partially destroyed to enable citizens to settle in their areas, a urgent human condition that exceeds urgent daily interventions to save life, but the Trump administration may aim at Stabilizing the status quo in Gaza is a repulsive environment, and a multi -faceted pressure paper, to push citizens to accept alternative options, including voluntary migration, as the absence of any possibility of life in the cities of the sector, from housing to ensure the minimum living, as well as finding job opportunities, not to mention Securing the future of children, while the narrative of living continues in the displacement camps in inhuman circumstances and constitutes a challenge Daily affects the lives of citizens, socially and economically, as well as human stinging in the camps, the competition for housing in the buildings qualifying to live makes citizens in a daily conflict for survival, in addition to the growing disputes between the people, while the economic and living aspect is another pressure card, This is by competing for the scarce resources in the sector, and then the perpetuation of this compulsive reality on the Palestinians, and the transfer of reconstruction Gaza to a bargaining paper, creates repellent conditions that may lead to the preference of those who are able to leave the Palestinians, and thus immigration voluntarily to avoid the misery of poverty.

Arab countries are still dealing with Palestine, either part of a normalization deal, or a security problem that affects their security Nationalist

For the security of Israel, not the security of the region, the American administration twins has its policies between dismantling historical Palestine and the displacement of the Palestinians, and the continued removal of the legal and sovereign characteristic of the Palestinian political bodies, whether the Palestinian Authority or Hamas, and according to the colonial doctrine itself, stripping them of the right to determine the fate of Palestine Determining its political future, as the survival or disappearance of Palestine according to the American policy is a product of the regional situation, and before it the art of managing the deals with Its partners, which is evident in its policies. As the best solution to the reconstruction of Gaza, but this upcoming policy does not only reflect the colonial character of the American administration, With its endeavor to displace the Palestinians from their land, purify Gaza, which means its blatant transgression against the right of the Palestinian people, and the violation of international covenants and laws, but this approach contradicts its internal policy, as the inauguration of a state. Trump is the second by force the refugees by force, in an illegal, or humanitarian way, and forcing their countries to restore its citizens, as it pressures the Egyptian and Jordanian authorities diplomatically, and by hinting by force, to accept the hosting of the Palestinians, and to transform Egypt and Jordan two alternative homelands for the Palestinians, violating diplomatic norms and states of states.
In exchange for the elaboration of the American administration, its vision for the future of Gaza, the official Arab position is still limited to facing these dangerous challenges, so the Arab countries are still dealing with Palestine either part of a major deal to normalize with Israel in the future, or as a security problem that affects their national security, including what is in That is the Palestinian neighborhood countries, and then we lack a unified Arab strategy, whether at the popular or official level, to face any Currency or bargains imposed by the American administration.
In the fateful battle, between the indigenous and occupied residents, the narrative of resistance to eradication and the calls for cleansing remain, and if the colonial powers still see in the peoples of the earth ""red Indians"" that can be destroyed and occupied by their homelands, then historical Palestine is an intense narrative to reject the dominance of power and superiority, As the people of Gaza, who traveled more than eighty kilometers on foot to return to their destroyed homes in the northern Gaza Strip, are in the greatest march of life in this century, they are the memory of today, tomorrow and the future, for the meaning and images of clinging to the homeland, and if they have the conditions of life of Cairo and the oppression of the occupiers.

Hani Abu Al -Sabaa: An American seeking to play a pivotal role in what is called ""New Gaza Building"" is a colonial and economic nature at the same time


In light of the recent statements made by US President Donald Trump about the displacement and occupation of the Gaza Strip residents, questions arise about the seriousness of these statements and the possibility of their implementation, especially as they came before the start of the second -stage talks of the prisoner exchange and ceasefire deal in the Gaza Strip.
A book, political analysts, specialists, and university professors, in separate conversations with ""?"", confirm that these statements, It contradicts international laws, reflects a deep coordination between the American right and the Israeli right, and reveals strategic plans aimed at reshaping political geography in the Middle East in favor of the Zionist project.
They point out that these statements in the context of Trump's support for the Zionist lists that helped him reach power, which raises fears of its transformation into actual policies on the ground.
They point out that these statements are not just individual opinions, but rather express a colonial ideological vision aimed at liquidating the Palestinian issue permanently, by talking about the displacement of the Palestinians and turning Gaza into an investment area, and this vision seeks to cancel the Palestinian national identity, and to impose forced solutions that do not take into account The rights of the Palestinian people in determining their fate, which are statements that are a flagrant violation of international law, especially the Fourth Geneva Convention that prohibits the displacement Forced.
And they confirm that the Palestinian people, which possesses a long history in resisting the occupation, will not accept the imposition of a new reality that threatens its existence and rights, and that diplomatic and legal moves can constitute effective tools to expose these policies and pressure the American administration To stop it.

Trump's comments are consistent with his promises to the Zionist lists

The writer and political analyst specializing in American affairs, Dr. Hussein Al -Deek, confirms that the statements of US President Donald Trump about the displacement and occupation of the people of the Gaza Strip did not come as a major surprise, as they are consistent with his previous promises to the Zionist lists in the United States during his campaign.
Deck explains that Trump had previously made several pledges to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but these pledges did not have wide international media coverage despite their danger.
Al -Deek notes that talking about the American security companies and the mercenaries that it is planning to manage in the Gaza Strip is not new, as it was taken in the American media several months ago, but the new in Trump's statements is his public release with these ideas, which clearly reveals his future aspirations, which are represented In the control of American security companies, even the Marines, or any other American forces on the Gaza Strip.
The most dangerous of this, as the rooster explains, is that these statements include a clear incitement to a forced displacement of a Palestinian population of Gaza, through their resettlement in countries such as Egypt, Jordan and possibly other countries.
And see The rooster is that this proposition reflects a renewed colonial vision that completely contradicts international laws and international agreements that prohibit such practices.
According to Hussein Al -Deek, Trump's statements cannot be considered merely personal opinions or political proposals. Rather, they rise to the level of public incitement to commit war crimes, according to international law. Or the collective of the population, and prohibits the transfer of citizens of the occupation state to the occupied lands.
Al -Deek believes that such statements, which are issued by the head of the most powerful country in the world, reveal an unprecedented level of ""foolishness and political insolence"", noting that the matter requires a wide Arab and international action to respond to it, as these statements are not limited to the political side only, but also to bear Legal and criminal dimensions that can be used to file complaints against Trump before the International Criminal Court on charges of inciting war crimes.

Palestinian and Arab move at the official and popular levels

The rooster invites the Arab countries, the Arab League and the PLO to take strict political and diplomatic positions to confront These dangerous statements, but he believes that the move should not be limited to the official level only, but must include popular and mass movements in the capitals of the world, especially in front of American embassies and consulates.
It indicates that the aim of this is to send a strong and clear message to the American administration that the Palestinian people are not a prejudice that can be tampered with their fate, and that he has the right to self -determination and establish an independent state on its historical land.
Al -Deek stresses that any attempt to impose American or foreign control over the Gaza Strip, whether through military forces or private security companies, will be met with a broad Palestinian popular rejection, and will be considered an illegal occupation force, and the Palestinians have a long experience in resisting the occupation and will not hesitate to confront any foreign forces It seeks to dominate their lands.
Despite the risk of Trump's statements, the rooster believes that the United States is not in the form of an official and direct occupation of the Gaza Strip, as Washington learned well the consequences of such a step, especially after its harsh experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, as it incurred huge human and material losses.
The real goal, according to the rooster, is to serve the extremist Israeli right agenda led by Netanyahu, And strengthening Israel's security by implementing strategic plans in the interest of the Zionist project in the region.
Al -Deek believes that Trump's statements that came after his meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu are not just individual jurisprudence, but rather part of deep secret understandings between the American right and the Israeli right, and these understandings were clearly evident during Trump's meetings and Netanyahu, and Netanyahu had previously spoken of them publicly from the United Nations platform, He stated that he is seeking to change the face of the Middle East.
Al -Deek notes that these statements reflect political and strategic coordination between the two parties, aimed at reshaping the political geography in the region in a way that serves Israeli interests.
However, the rooster believes that these plans will remain just wishes, and will not turn into a reality on the ground because of the steadfastness and adherence of the Palestinian people to the Palestinian people.
The rooster confirms that the Palestinian people will continue to resist any attempt to impose a new reality at the expense of their national rights, whether this threat comes from the United States or from any other force.

Current the crimes of genocide against the Palestinian people

Diplomacy and Conflict Resolution at the Arab American League, Dr. Dalal Erekat, believes that Trump's statements are about Control of Gaza and the displacement of its inhabitants does not reflect merely a transient political position, but rather expresses a dangerous ideological vision that adopts the urban colonial thought in its pragmatic modern dress to end the Palestinian issue.
Erekat explains that these statements are not isolated from the context of previous US policy in Trump's first state, as it reflects the same approach that Trump followed in issues such as Jerusalem and settlements, by imposing facts on the ground by force, in a flagrant violation of international law and the United Nations Charter.
Erekat notes that Trump's vision represents, according to international law, a crime of forced displacement against the Palestinian people, a crime of seizing the ground by coercion, as well as being a promotion of the crime of collective punishment, all of which are classified as war crimes.
Erekat considers that what is happening today in Gaza is a suffocating siege, widespread destruction and systematic killing that is completely in line with this policy that aims to destroy the elements of Palestinian life and force the Palestinians to accept forced solutions that do not meet their national aspirations, stressing that Trump's statements are only the culmination of the crimes of genocide committed against The Palestinian people for decades.
Erekat stresses that facing this danger requires urgent action All levels: political, legal and media, calling for the disclosure of these aggressive policies in front of the international community and exposing its plans aimed at liquidating the Palestinian issue, noting that the international silence towards these statements and policies may explain as indirect collons with the crimes committed.

A rooted current seeks to re -impose colonial domination

Erekat notes that although Trump's statements do not necessarily reflect the position of the current American administration, it reveals the presence of a political trend rooted within the United States seeking to re -impose colonial domination on Palestine and the world.
She believes that this current represents a danger not only to the Palestinians, but also on the international system, because it promotes policies that contradict the principles of international law and human rights.
Erekat asserts that international law is clear in rejecting any claim of occupied land ownership or imposing illegal guardianship over it, and any attempt of this kind constitutes a flagrant violation of the Geneva Conventions and the United Nations Charter.
Erekat considers that what is happening in Gaza today of the siege, starvation and destruction of the infrastructure is a blatant form of internationally prohibited collective punishment, as these methods are used. As political tools to impose surrender or pushing the Palestinians towards forced displacement.
Erekat notes that these practices put the United States in a position hostile to international law, which gradually isolates it from the international system based on legitimacy and law.
Erekat links Trump's statements and his last meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, stressing that this meeting reveals a profound consensus between the far -right and Israeli right on the agenda of liquidating the Palestinian issue.
Erekat explains that Trump's vision not only ignores the rights of the Palestinians, but rather intentionally ignoring the fact that the Palestinians are not just a ""population"" that can be displaced or replaced, but they are an authentic people who seek to build their independent state and develop Gaza as a prosperous economic center, and not as a permanent war field.
Erekat stresses that Trump's statements are an existential threat to the Palestinian issue, as it aims to liquidate it and eliminate the political rights of the Palestinian people, foremost of which is his right to self -determination.
Erekat believes that these statements are not just an electoral speech, but rather a public encouragement to commit war crimes against the Palestinians, which requires a unified Palestinian response and wide international support, especially from countries The influencer, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and France, to lead an international alliance that reveals the seriousness of these policies and works to thwart them through the available legal and political tools.

References that exceed the risk of displacement or the possibility of annexation

The writer, political analyst, concerned with diplomatic affairs and international relations, Nour Odeh, warns of the danger of Trump's recent statements, which go beyond the idea of ??displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip or even the possibility of annexing the West Bank.
Odeh believes that the real danger lies in the mentality from which Trump starts to deal with the Palestinian issue, which reflects a dangerous colonial vision that deals with the Palestinian people as if it is just a passing group of population that can be transferred and resettled anywhere else without regard to their history, national identity and political rights.
Odeh confirms that the way Trump spoke about the Palestinians expresses a mentality outside the context of international law and human history, as it deals with the Palestinians as if they are a people without roots, they do not have any belonging or historical right in their land, and this trend represents an existential threat to the Palestinian people because it denies Their presence as a national entity has internationally recognized rights, He tries to dwarf their case to merely a ""population problem"" that can be resolved by paying money and providing job opportunities elsewhere, without admitting their right to self -determination or return to their land.
Odeh indicates that this mentality is withdrawn on the West Bank, and the possibility of dealing with the Palestinian presence in it as a ""population problem"", especially in light of the systematic destruction of Jenin, Tulkarm and others.
""We are facing a speech that does not recognize the political rights of the Palestinians, but rather reduces their presence in economic considerations, and this is the real danger, because dealing with the Palestinians in this way means canceling their identity, history and legitimate struggle for freedom and independence.""
The return of Trump's statements links a broader vision that exceeds mere military occupation or direct displacement, as it sees that the current American-Israeli project seeks to achieve its goals through economic and investment strategies.
Odeh explains that Trump does not look at Gaza as a human or political issue, but rather as an economic site that can be invested to serve the interests of those close to it, including Jared Kushner, his son -in -law and his former advisor, who stated at the beginning of the aggression on Gaza that ""the only solution to Gaza is the displacement of its residents And convert it into an investment area full of resorts and villas on the beach. ""
Odeh believes that this perception is not just a passing idea, but rather is part of an integrated plan that seeks to empty Gaza from its indigenous population, and to reshape it in a way that serves the interests of investors associated with the Trump administration.
""We should not underestimate these statements because it reflects a real vision that has a direct impact on American decision -making, especially in light of a complex network of political, ideological, economic and family interests that link Trump to the Israeli influence circles,"" Awda says.
Odeh confirms that the occupation or modern colonialism is not necessarily implemented by sending soldiers only, but can be achieved through economic acquisition, controlling resources and preventing any economic recovery process in Gaza.
She points out that talking about sending American Marines to Gaza may be excluded for reasons related to American internal policy, but this does not eliminate the seriousness of the project based on the subjugation of the Gaza Strip through the economic blockade and restriction of the reconstruction process for the benefit of American and Israeli investors.
Odeh believes that Trump is not just an ordinary American president, but rather a coalition leader Homogeneous includes different parties with one goal: achieving political and economic gains at the expense of the Palestinian issue.
Odeh explains that this alliance includes a group of right -wing ideological extremists, and major funders such as Maryam Adeleson, who provided more than $ 250 million for Trump's election campaign for his commitment to supporting Israeli extremist policies, including recognition of the West Bank.
Odeh indicates that Netanyahu is well aware of how to use this situation, as he is adept at reading the American political scene and knows how to play on the strings of economic interests and ideological extremism within the Republican Party. ""Netanyahu sees in the Trump period a golden opportunity to achieve the goals of the extreme Israeli right, and he does not hesitate to use this opportunity to the maximum extent possible.""

The Palestinians face a historical challenge

Odeh confirms that the Palestinians are facing a historical challenge that requires them to overcome traditional discourse and immediately respond to practical plans on the ground.
Odeh believes that political data and diplomatic objections are no longer sufficient to confront this existential danger, calling for the reassessment of Palestinian strategies to confront a project Liquidation of national identity.
""We need a real practical action that goes beyond just statements,"" Awda says.
Odeh stresses that ""not dealing with these threats seriously will make the Palestinian issue a mere historical memory in the books of Nestille,"" calling for thinking deeply and seriously about how to protect the Palestinian presence politically and geographically in the face of a new colonial project that takes the economy as a cover to achieve its goals by controlling the land and reformulating it To serve specific economic and strategic interests.

An excuse for the Israeli right to move after Gaza to the West Bank

The writer and political analyst d. Abdul Majeed Swailem The statements of US President Donald Trump regarding control of Gaza and the displacement of Palestinians from them express a dangerous essence related to the American position on the Palestinian issue, and perhaps the most dangerous in the history of American policy towards Palestine, indicating that it reveals a clear agreement between the American and Israeli right to liquidate the issue The Palestinian is decisively and final, regardless of means and methods Used.
Sweilem explains that what came from Trump is considered an unimaginable evidence of the existence of an old plan to liquidate the Palestinian issue, which did not start after the seventh of October 2023, as some believe.
Swailem confirms that this plan targets the entire Palestinian issue, and not only Gaza or Hamas, warning that Trump's statements are giving the Israeli oath an excuse to move after Gaza to the West Bank, which means a threat to collective displacement and a new ethnic cleansing against the Palestinians.
Sweilem explains that the plan to liquidate the Palestinian issue is an American-Israeli plan, a court that began to appear clearly for years, indicating that the seventh of October 2023 was only a station in the context of this plan, and not its starting point, pointing out that the Palestinians should feel the seriousness of this Developments on the future of their national cause.
Swailem notes that this plan is not only directed against the Palestinians, but rather a direct threat to Jordan and Egypt and perhaps for Saudi Arabia as well, which explains the decisive positions recently taken by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Swailem considers that the Saudi reaction reflects a profound understanding of the real threat that threatens the entire region, not Palestine Alone.
Swailem believes that Trump's statements are an expression of political ignorance and strategic stupidity, indicating that it reveals an understanding of the nature of the conflict in the region and the Palestinian people adhere to their national right.
Sweilem believes that these statements will fall quickly, not only because they threaten the Palestinians, but because they are a threat to the interests of major Arab countries.

A clear flop in American policy

Swailem expects Trump to back away from his statements, noting that such confused positions will make him an international mockery, just as it happened with his previous stances related to Mexico and Canada.
Sweilem asserts that the American policy, as Trump reflects, suffers from a clear confusion, noting that the United States may pay a heavy price for this reckless political approach.
Sweilem considers that what Trump said reflects a deeper crisis in the structure of the American regime itself, likening this stage to the rise of fascism in Europe in the 1930s.
Swailem notes that ""Termasa"" is not just a passing political phenomenon, but rather expresses a stage of deterioration in the American capitalist system, noting that this deterioration may lead to major transformations on the international scene.
He notes that the current American crisis is not Just as a result of political errors, it reflects the stage of rot in the entire Western capitalist system.
Swailem confirms that Trump's statements are redefining global alignments, as it has become clear that the world has two options: either standing with Israel, which exercises killing and brutality policies, or with Palestine, which is fighting for its just rights.
Swailem considers that these statements may serve the Palestinian issue indirectly, because it clearly reveals the true face of American-Israeli policies towards the Palestinian people and their legitimate rights.

A colonial and economic character

The writer and political analyst and specialist in Israeli affairs, Hani Abu Al -Sebaa, confirms that Trump's statements about the displacement and the occupation of Gaza are not merely transient political positions, but rather reflecting dangerous orientations that are in line with the vision of the Israeli extremist right and seeks to impose a new reality in the Middle East, by pressuring the Palestinians to accept forced displacement or Voluntary.
Abu Al -Sabaa notes that the United States, through these trends, not only aims to pressure the people of Gaza, but also seeks to play a pivotal role in the so -called ""building of new Gaza"", which reveals American intentions that go beyond the human dimension to take a nature Colonially and economically at the same time.
According to Abu Al -Sabaa, the Palestinian response to these threats is clear and clear. The Palestinian people expressed their adherence to their land, despite all the occupation pressures and practices.
Abu Al -Sabaa notes that the return of the Palestinians from the south of Gaza to its north after the last truce is a strong message to the world confirming that this people will not abandon their land, whatever the challenges.
Abu Al -Sabaa stresses the need to unify the Palestinian ranks in the face of these plans, calling on the Palestinian Authority to assume its responsibilities in exposing the American crimes and trends on the international scene.
He praises the Arab positions rejecting these policies, pointing to the statements of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi, who clearly emphasized his rejection of the idea of ??displacement, in addition to the position of the Jordanian monarch, King Abdullah II, who stressed that ""Jordan for Jordanians and Palestine for the Palestinians.""

Features of a new American project

Abu Al -Sabaa believes that Trump's statements reflect the features of a new American project aimed at reshaping the region, and this project is not limited to the Gaza Strip, but also extends to the West Bank and perhaps parts of neighboring Arab countries.
Abu Al -Sabaa confirms that The pressures exerted by the United States today are not new, but it has begun to take a more clear nature in line with the ambitions of Israel, indicating that the Palestinian wounded and their companions leave for treatment abroad signing pledges not to return to the Gaza Strip, is a dangerous indication of the existence of a real intention to impose a reality A new demographic in the sector.
However, Abu Al -Sebaea believes that these plans will eventually fail in front of the steadfastness of the Palestinian people and their adherence to their land and rights.
Abu Al -Sebaa affirms that the Palestinian people have enough will and patience to confront such plans, citing the popular saying among the Gazans: “Whoever finally came to this land, let him leave first”, referring to the Israeli settlers who settled Palestine at the expense of the indigenous people.
He points out that what Trump wants clearly intersects with the vision of the leaders of the Israeli extremist right, such as Bastel Smotrich, who explicitly spoke about a new map of Israel that extends even inside Jordanian territory.
Abu Al -Sabaa notes that during the recent war on Gaza, Israel tried to expand its settlement control, but it failed to achieve this because of The fierce Palestinian resistance.
Abu Al -Sabaa believes that, during the war on Gaza, the United States used hidden means to impose its influence, such as the ""floating port"", which was announced as a means of transporting humanitarian aid, but in fact it was aimed at introducing special forces to liberate Israeli prisoners, however, this attempt failed And the bridge was dismantled after the Palestinians realized its true nature.
According to Abu Al -Sabaa, Trump is not a political man as much as he is an economy man who seeks to exploit political files to achieve economic gains.
Abu Al -Sabaa believes that Trump's statements about the Gaza Strip stem from his desire to ensure a major American role in the reconstruction of the sector, as he realizes that reconstruction projects will be very profitable, especially in light of some Arab countries' readiness to contribute to these efforts.
Abu Al -Sabaa notes that Trump is trying, through these statements, to pressure the Arab countries to accept his plans, taking advantage of the weak official positions that are still ""shy"" and do not rise to the level of challenges facing the Palestinian issue.
Abu Al -Sabaa notes that Trump's statements about the displacement of the Palestinians are completely consistent with the policies he followed during his presidency. The first, as he made unprecedented steps to support Israel, such as moving the American embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan, and today, Trump strengthens his support for Israel by canceling the sanctions imposed on settlers and opening weapons stores to support the Israeli army, which was not available in the same way Power in the era of the Biden administration.
Abu Al -Sabaa believes that the next stage will be the stage of trying to impose the American -Israeli vision on the region, by pressuring the Palestinians and the Arab countries to accept the plans of displacement and liquidate the Palestinian issue.
Abu Al -Sabaa stresses that the ultimate goal of these policies is to eliminate the dream of establishing an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 borders, calling for the unification of Palestinian and Arab positions to confront these challenges.",PS

On the newspaper's tour today, we read an article on the work of the American Agency for International Development and the implications of US President Donald Trump's decision about it, and another article on Trump's decisions related to the imposition of new customs duties, and finally, we read an article on Gaza and attempts to forced displacement offered to its residents.
We start from the writer Nicholas Christophe, who deals with the New York Times, which he called the chaos in the USAID Agency (USAID), highlighting the humanitarian repercussions caused by the policies of US President Donald Trump and businessman Illon Musk towards international aid.
Christophe believes that Trump's criticism and mask of external aid may be justified in principle, as auditing and reform are required, but he indicates that the implementation of these policies led to harsh results, as he left the poorest children of the world in harsh suffering due to chaos and confusion.
The writer confirms that children in Sokoto Nigeria are starving as a result of the interruption of the curative food paste supplies supported by the American Agency for International Development, and although this putty is available in warehouses, the The agency is unable to issue permits for distribution due to the internal chaos it lives.

Christophe states that the Ebola epidemic has spread in Uganda, but due to the chaos in the US agency, the Ugandan government appealed to the medical staff working with the agency to continue working without a fee, with a national motive. The writer believes that the absence of the agency from work means increasing the risk of Ebola's spread globally, and perhaps its arrival in the United States, which proves that the agency does not only serve human values, but it constitutes the first line of defense against epidemics that threaten US national security.
Christophe notes that reports on the agency's chaos are flowing from all over the world, pointing out that journalist Stephanie Nolin from the Times newspaper documented 30 clinical trials suddenly due to the failure of the agency's financing, which led to leaving patients without treatment.

The writer notes that women and children are the largest victims of this chaos, as research institutes estimate that 130,000 women are deprived daily of contraceptives, and that the lack of male condoms has become a crisis in Zimbabwe, and if the aid continues to be freezed for three months, it is expected that this will lead to this To 4.2 million unintended pregnancy and 8,300 deaths among women during childbirth, according to the estimates of the Gottmesh Institute.
The writer quotes one of the agency's employees in Africa as saying: ""We are completely paralyzed, no one is responsible,"" noting that the frustration that prevails within the agency after the decisions that led to the freezing of vital projects.
Christophe believes that Elon Musk has not yet proven any clear fraud, and that the only violation of the law lies in the Trump attack on the agency without having the legal authority to close it, but that the agency's destruction may be a violation of a series of federal laws and the American constitution itself.
The writer notes that the Republicans justified this chaos with allegations about wasting aid funds, although many of the examples that they have cited have nothing to do with the American Agency for International Development.
He adds that Trump and Mask made waste worse, as the agency's Inspector General warned that $ 489 million of food aid has become threatened with damage, after distribution systems stopped working.
Christophe believes that the destruction of the American Agency for International Development represents a major human tragedy, as the decisions taken by the richest world have already led to the death of the poorest of the world, stressing that the agency was not perfect, but it was a lifestyle for millions of people around the world, and what is happening now may lead to To a widespread health and humanitarian catastrophe.
In its article published in the Journal of Foreign Policy, writer Keith Johnson warns of the negative economic repercussions of US President Donald Trump's decisions to impose customs duties on steel and aluminum, noting that these policies not only threaten the American economy, but also undermines the broader American strategy by intentionally targeting the allies with restrictions Arbitous commercial.
The writer believes that the situation may get worse if the Trump administration goes on to implement its plans to impose ""mutual"" definitions wider on most countries, which may constitute a severe blow to the potential partners of the United States in South Asia and South East Asia, as well as straining relations with Europe.
Johnson notes that Trump's commercial policy is not limited to the imposition of customs duties, but also to include other decisions, such as the dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development, which opened the door to increasing Chinese influence in the developing world.
The writer adds that Trump's unilateral policies are not limited to trade and economy, but rather extend to the security field, noting that the appointment of Tolcy Gabbard to the position of US intelligence president may reduce the exchange of intelligence information between the United States and its allies.
Johnson notes that Trump's plan to seize Gaza, along with his expansionist policies, has angered allies in the Middle East, Europe and the Americas, which exacerbates the state of international diplomatic tension. She adds that the customs duties imposed by Trump are a clear example of his failed economic policies, as it leads to raising prices, killing jobs, slowing growth, as well as its negative repercussions at the strategic level.
The writer believes that the most ridiculous reason, she said, is that Trump imposed these definitions on the pretext of protecting US national security, While its real impact is on US allies, not China, which is the main source of cheap steel.
The author explains that the customs definitions imposed by the Trump administration cast a negative shadow over Washington's traditional allies, such as Mexico, Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan, and South Korea.
And it indicates that some allies tried to negotiate to reduce the sanctions, as Japan submitted an official request for that, and South Korea is seeking a compromise, while Australia tries to adhere to optimism after talks with Trump, but it may be disappointed, while Mexico and Canada are already under a constant threat of imposition New definitions, while the UK appears confused in its position, while the European Union is preparing to respond to imposing procedures Revelation.
Johnson quotes Kaya Callas, the European Union's foreign policy official, saying: ""China is the party that laughs on the other side, while Europe and the United States are immersed in destructive trade wars of both parties.""

To Al -Sharq Al -Awsat newspaper and an article by the writer Hoda Al -Husseini, his entity that “Gaza will not be a real estate deal or a ridera An American, ""in which he deals with the vision of former US President Donald Trump about Gaza.
And it indicates that his idea of ??US control of the sector raises increasing Arab objections, in light of questions about its real intentions and what this plan might mean to the region.
She adds that American opinion polls have shown that 47 percent of Americans reject the idea of ??their country's acquisition of Gaza, which reflects the lack of internal acceptance of this proposal.
Al -Husseini believes that some of Trump's close associates in the fields of national security and foreign policy believe that he uses the ""negotiating shock"" method to impose a change in the Middle East, and it is quoted by National Security Adviser Mike and Al -Taz as saying that the president does not see realistic solutions to how the destruction left by the war in Gaza Noting that Trump is seeking to offer new bold ideas to push the region towards finding its own solutions.
A judge temporarily stops Trump's plan to reduce US government employees
After Trump imposed sanctions on it, what do we know about the International Criminal Court? What are its powers?
Al -Husseini notes that during one of his speeches, Trump suggested that the United States take a ""long -term ownership"" of Gaza with the aim of its reconstruction and development. With the resettlement of some residents elsewhere, this proposal was met with a sharp rejection of the main regional players, who see themselves directly concerned with any plan to rebuild Gaza or resettle its population.
The writer explains that everyone is aware of the need for the reconstruction of Gaza and the end of the suffering of its residents, but the basic condition that everyone seems to be agreed upon is to provide security before any development process, and indicates that emptying the sector of its two million people is unrealistic in the severe century The twenty, where some individuals may accept to leave the Strip, but the vast majority will not agree to this, given the Palestinian history full of displacement and asylum.

Al -Husseini adds that the United States may act independently in Gaza, but it will face violent reactions from extremist powers, and if this plan is just an imposed American vision, its success will depend on the acceptance of the Palestinians themselves, in addition to the approval of the active regional states that have a direct and interest. In the future of the sector, it indicates that this element is currently missing in the Trump plan, which makes its success in doubt.
Al -Husseini raises a question about How to finance any major development project in Gaza if Trump's vision is to convert the sector into ""Rvira Middle East"", and it confirms that the only real influence that Washington has on this issue lies in the financial aid it provides to Egypt and Jordan, but that does not mean that Cairo and Amman will accept The settlement plan, especially in light of the positions rejecting strongly from the Egyptian and Jordanian peoples.
Al -Husseini believes that Trump, by presenting this idea, does not present a clear plan as much as he tries to ""plant a seed"" for a new idea, which may contribute to creating a new reality in the region, however, confirms that any solution must ""respect the rights of the Palestinians, and guarantee security The Israeli occupation entity, taking into account the approval of the actors in the region, which has not yet been achieved.

Suleiman Shuqirat: The return of the residents from the south of the Strip to the north
Moeen Odeh: The old Smotrich plan is ancient renewable and is in line with the goals of the war that Netanyahu started against the Palestinian people

The statements made by US President Donald Trump recently about the displacement of the people of the Gaza Strip, sometimes to Indonesia, and at other times to Jordan and Egypt, with all its fruits, political rudeness and superiority, in dealing with the issue of a people who have been fighting for nearly a hundred years in order to obtain their rights to freedom and emancipation On his land and not on the lands of others.

These statements intersect and harmonize with the trends of the Israeli right to get rid From the Palestinians, whether in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank, and for this, the occupying state launched an unprecedented aggressive war in modern history to purify the sector of its sons and its people who were patient and withstanded under the showers of rockets and shells and in light of starvation, thirst and displacement for more than fifteen months, to surprise the world They crawled hundreds of thousands to the rubble of their homes, sticking to their survival on their land.

Clerics, analysts and writers spoke to ""Al -Quds"" said that the old Smotrich plan is renewed and is in line with the goals of the war that Netanyahu started against the Palestinian people, stressing that the return of the residents from the south of the Gaza Strip to its north has dropped the American -Israeli plan with forced displacement, and that the scenes of the return of the displaced in Gaza constitute a message It is clear that there is no decision above their decision and no abdication of their homeland.


The Palestinian people refuse to displace and adhere to their land

Sheikh Dr. Ikrima Sabri, head of the Higher Islamic Authority, confirmed that the Palestinian people are adhering to their land and rejecting all plans for displacement.

He said: “These plans aim to dominate the blessed Al -Aqsa Mosque, and to weaken the Palestinian people who insist on preserving it. He added:“ Our people are conscious and do not need a guardian He must give him decisions and dictate to him. The Palestinian people resurrected during 100 years of the occupation and did not give up their land and sacrificed for that and made a lot. ""

Sheikh Sabri explained that the scenes of the return of the displaced in Gaza constitute a ""clear message that there is no decision above their decision and no abdication of our homeland.""

Sheikh Sabri praised ""all international positions that reject the displacement of the Palestinian from his land, led by Egypt and Jordan, who clearly declared their rejection of the plans of displacement and the alternative homeland.""

Sabri stressed that the Palestinian people will not abandon their blessed Al -Aqsa Mosque, which is part of his faith, warning of ""the repercussions of Israeli arrogance and its ambitions in the settlement expansion."" He stressed the necessity of ""putting an end to this aggression, which aims to Judaize Jerusalem and empty the land of its inhabitants.""

Sheikh Sabri called on the Islamic nation to ""unite its ranks and reject all the plans and agents of the occupation, to preserve the blessed Al -Aqsa Mosque and prevent any plan aimed at emptying the land from its residents.""

Attempts to displace Palestinians into distant countries

For his part, Egyptian analyst Hani Al -Jamal said that Smotrich's statements during the ""Cabinet"" meeting on forced deportation come in agreement with some of the ideas that were previously presented.

Indicate The camel that these consensus was among the reasons that the hostage deal was completed between Hamas and Israel, while Netanyahu and his government defended the approval of this deal.

He explained that there are consensus within the Israeli government, including the transfer of military operations from Gaza to the West Bank, and an attempt to control them again, in addition to increasing settlement expansion, as nearly 20% of the area of ??the neighboring Palestinian territories has been controlled so far.

Al -Jamal stressed that the ""burned land"" policy pursued by Israel aims to provide a wide security cover around the settlements, which increases the area of ??the lands it controls.

He explained that Israel is seeking to change the demographic composition of the region, in coordination between Netanyahu and the extreme right led by Smotrich.

He added: These calls are in line with the statements of former US President Donald Trump, who during the past hours called for the displacement of a million and a half Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries such as Jordan and Egypt, or even to other countries such as Albania, which received a request to receive 100,000 Palestinian refugees.

Al -Jamal indicated that there are also attempts to displace the Palestinians into remote countries such as Indonesia and other Islamic countries.

An Israeli went to re -escalate the war on Gaza

Al -Jamal talked about the appointment of the Chief of Staff in the Israeli army, with a militant orientation to re -escalate the war on Gaza after the first phase of the ""Peace Agreement"", which will increase the suffering of the Palestinians to push them towards voluntary displacement.
He stressed that Israel will seek to prevent the reconstruction of Gaza completely or to hinder these efforts.

Al -Jamal explained that there are American movements led by Trump and his extremist management to conclude deals with some Palestinian parties, whether authority or Hamas, to ensure acceptance of these ideas, as well as pressure using financial aid.

He stressed that some countries will contribute to financing projects aimed at voluntary displacement of the Palestinians to neighboring countries or Islamic countries.

However, the camel sees that the Palestinian people remain the great obstacle in front of these plans, as the Palestinians have repeatedly rejected any forced or voluntary displacement, whether inside or outside the borders. He stressed that the strict Egyptian and Jordanian position in rejecting these policies will enhance the steadfastness of the Palestinians.

Al -Jamal pointed out that Israel's attempts to increase pressure, such as stopping dealing with the UNRWA agency, may exacerbate the conditions of the Palestinians in a way Great, but the long history of their suffering will make them more insisting on facing these plans, especially in light of the displacement they suffered in 1948 and robbing their legitimate rights.

Smotrich's plan for disinfection and displacement is not new

Dr. Thaer Abu Ras, a lecturer in the Department of Political Science at the University of Maryland - Washington, believes that Smotrich's plan is not new, indicating that Smotrich had developed a 2017 plan called the ""Decisive Plan"".

He said: ""Part of the decisive plan includes encouraging the Palestinians, not only in Gaza, but also in the West Bank, to migrate.

He added: ""As for those who refuse to migrate, he must live as"" jealousy ""in the land of Israel, a term taken from the Torah, which is intended to live as second -class residents, and not even as citizens.

Abu Ras stressed that the ideas of cleansing and displacement presented by Smotrich are not new, but rather put them in a written framework for several years.

He explained that Israel, in fact, does not have the tools necessary to implement such plans, and that what is currently proposed is only a test balloons presented to the international community.

He added: ""Israel is unable to impose the expulsion of the population, especially from the Gaza Strip, because this will face a rejection Decisive from Egypt, which considers this a great threat to its national security. Also, this decision will affect Arab national security in general, in addition to that it may affect US national security.

He continued: ""The United States, as the most powerful country in the world, does not have an interest in destabilizing global stability. It cannot accept the purification of a million people from the Gaza Strip easily, because this may inspire other countries to carry out similar actions, just as China may decide to purify its territory from Uighur or Russia From the Ukrainians.

The current American administration does not take into account diplomatic tact

Abu Ras stressed that the current American administration is different from the previous departments, as it does not take into account the diplomatic tact or deep American interests as understood by the ""deep state"".

He said: ""For this reason, we hear such statements, but so far they lack a systematic and organized plan to implement displacement or purification.""

He added: ""The Israelis seem like angry children who make conflicting and unrealistic statements, such as sending the residents of Gaza to the Congo, Malaysia, or Indonesia, and sometimes to Egypt or Jordan. Even the Israeli media recently spoke about the possibility of sending 100 thousand refugees from Gaza to Albania. But all these suggestions are just attempts to launch a test balloons, and the possibility of their implementation does not exceed zero or nearly. ""

Abu Ras indicated that Israel uses the pressure paper related to the reconstruction of Gaza, considering that the great destruction in Gaza and its need for reconstruction represents one of the basic pressure tools.

He said: ""Israel may delay the reconstruction, especially in the northern Gaza Strip, or at least it may seek to build much lower housing units than it was present before the seventh of October.""

Abu Ras concluded his speech to ""Jerusalem"" by saying: ""Israel will take advantage of this paper to pressure, in cooperation with the United States, on the issue of reconstruction and humanitarian aid.""

Encourage immigration through financial temptations and privileges

In turn, Dr. said. Mansour Abu Karim, a researcher in political affairs and international relations, that the Smotrich plan has resonated with Trump since the latter launched his statement that the Arab countries should be asked to receive a number of Palestinian citizens from the Gaza Strip.

He added: This idea was supported by Bin Ghaffir and Hemottich, especially since the latter is the owner of the theory of ""resolving the conflict"", which is that It is based on the elimination of any hope for the establishment of a Palestinian state, and to achieve this by deporting the Palestinians to neighboring countries.

Abu Karim pointed out that Trump's vision, which is expected to implement it, has found echoes with the Israeli government, specifically with Smotrich, who calls for cooperation with Trump to facilitate the so -called ""voluntary immigration"" for the Palestinians, especially after the massive destruction left by the war in Gaza , As the destruction of infrastructure and homes increased pressure on the population, some of whom lead to thinking about immigration.

Abu Karim explained that the tools of implementing this migration include providing financial temptations and privileges, whether to the countries of Europe, Canada, the United States or some Arab countries.

He added: Israel has worked in the past and recently to displace the Palestinians, whether in the West Bank or the Gaza Strip, due to the high population density in the Strip.

He pointed out that Israel has always used policies aimed at encouraging immigration under the cover of searching for job opportunities or studying, noting that many of the projects presented by Israeli governments, whether through the Moshe Dayan project or others, were aimed at reducing the population of the Gaza Strip via Facilitating immigration procedures to Western countries and giving Palestinians privileges to reside there.

Arab countries are definitely rejecting the displacement of the Palestinians

As for the position of the Arab countries, Abu Karim stressed that the Arab countries reject these policies as part of the Israeli vision to solve the Palestinian issue through forced displacement.

He explained that Egypt and Jordan, in particular, completely rejects dealing with such projects, whether in the past or present.

He added: ""There is a fear of Jordan that the Israeli government will displace large numbers of Palestinians from the West Bank towards its lands, and Egypt fears the displacement of the residents of the Gaza Strip to the Sinai.

He pointed out that Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi refused at the beginning of the war the Israeli request to allow the displaced from the northern Gaza and Gaza City to cross the border to the Sinai, considering this as a threat to Egyptian national security.

Abu Karim stressed that there is a clear position on the Egyptian leadership, whether at the political or popular level, not to deal with any attempts to displace the Palestinians. He also stressed that the Palestinian position is clear and decisive, as the Palestinian presidency warned against Trump's vision, which It is in line with the trends of the ruling right in Israel.

The Palestinian people in Gaza will not leave it under any circumstance

For his part, Jerusalem political analyst Suleiman Shuqirat considered that the return of tens of thousands of Palestinian people from the southern Gaza Strip to its north has dropped the goal of the Netanyahu government of forced displacement.

He pointed out that the invitation of former US President Donald Trump to Egypt and Jordan to receive the residents of Gaza for the reconstruction of the Strip suggests that the people of Gaza are waiting for those who open their doors to them, adding: ""If they wanted to emigrate, they would do so while they were bombing and destroying their homes.""

He considered that Egypt and Jordan's rejection of this call is normal and certain.

Shuqirat stressed that the attempts of the resigned Israeli National Security Minister Etamar bin Ghaffir and the Minister of Finance in Salail Smotrich to achieve the idea of ??""voluntary displacement"" through financial temptations and travel facilities are fate of failure, saying: ""These attempts will not be successful whatever they do, as there is no destruction or destruction more than they did. "".

He added: The Palestinian people in Gaza will restore their reconstruction and will not leave it under any circumstance.

He also saw that the return of the population from the south of the Strip to the north of the US -Israeli plan that was It aims to forced displacement through the war of destruction and genocide.

Ending the aggressive war for political and personal reasons

Shuqirat considered that Trump's recent statements, in which he called Egypt and Jordan to receive the residents of Gaza, comes in response to Bin Ghafir's public requests, and the view of Netanyahu, which aims to make Gaza ""ruin and unpopular.""

He emphasized that this real goal is backed under slogans such as the elimination of Hamas and the resistance, and the restoration of the prisoners by force, which was considered impossible, pointing to the experience of General Ariel Sharon, who decided to withdraw from Gaza as a result of the Al -Aqsa Intifada in the year 2004, and adopted the same approach as the former Prime Minister Ehud Barak He decided to withdraw from southern Lebanon in 2000 under the pressure of the Lebanese resistance.

He explained that Netanyahu insists on prolonging the aggressive war for the maximum possible extent of political and personal reasons related to his pursuit of corruption, bribery and bad trust.

Shuqirat considered that this insistence has involved Netanyahu and his military leaderships in the charges of committing war crimes, and genocide will be discussed before the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice, which will reveal to the world the true image of the Zionist state. Her pictures, ""which is the image that has been camouflaged for decades.

Continuing the policy of genocide and forced displacement

Lawyer Moeen Odeh, a specialist in international law, stressed that Smotrich is preparing a plan to deport the residents of the Gaza Strip to three Arab countries and another Asian state.

He explained that this plan is clearly in line with the statements of US President Donald Trump, who explicitly asked Egypt and Jordan to receive the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.

He added that Smotrich's plan is old renewed, and is in line with the goals of the war that Netanyahu started against the Palestinian people, and the Gaza Strip in particular, with the aim of emptying it from the population.

Odeh pointed out that, for Israel, its success in emptying part of the sector will help it achieve some of the war goals, and what it failed to achieve militarily, is trying to impose it later through other means.

He also stressed that all the Arab countries that were mentioned in this context categorically reject the displacement of the Palestinians, and both Egypt and Jordan clearly expressed their refusal to receive them. Likewise, the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip reject the idea of ??displacement and will not allow it.

Odeh stressed that all these proposals are nothing but a continuation of the policy of genocide and forced displacement, Which is war crimes in accordance with international law.

Odeh added: Smotich, with his settlement mentality, sees the Gaza Strip an empty area seeking to rebuild settlements in it.",PS
"On Monday, Israeli Finance Minister of Smotricht, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, called for offering US President Donald Trump's plan to displace the Palestinians of the Gaza Strip on the mini -cabinet (cabinet) for approval.

This came in his speech during the meeting of the parliamentary bloc of the ""Religious Zionism Party"" at its chairmanship, according to the Hebrew Special Channel Seven.

Smotrich reiterated his opposition to the ceasefire agreement and the exchange of prisoners with Hamas, and said: ""My responsibility is towards the State of Israel, its future and its security, and this requires me to oppose the abandonment of millions of citizens all over the world who will pay the high and terrible price to continue the deal,"" he said.

He continued: ""I am criticized because of my position, including painful and harsh statements from the families of the detainees and others, but I am fixed in my opposition (to the agreement).""

In referring to the possible steps to liberate the remaining prisoners in Gaza, Smotrich said: ""We must stop transferring humanitarian aid to Hamas completely, and Gaza must be occupied permanently to prevent another massacre,"" he said, referring to the October 7, 2023 attack. .

He called for taking measures to encourage The emigration of the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip in coordination with the American administration.

Netanyahu addressed: ""The plan of US President (Donald) Trump (regarding the displacement of the Palestinians) must be presented to the Security Political Council (cabinet) to approve it as soon as possible, in order to prepare for the immediate action as soon as the first stage of the deal is completed.""

He claimed that ""this is the only realistic way to force Hamas to surrender and raise the white flag and flee for its life, in exchange for the release of all the kidnappers (detainees), until the last one.""

On February 4, Trump revealed a press conference with Netanyahu at the White House, his country's intention to seize Gaza after the displacement of its entire population from the Palestinians to other countries.

Trump did not rule out the possibility of deploying American forces to support the reconstruction of Gaza, expecting that the United States will have a ""long -term ownership"" in the Palestinian sector, while Netanyahu welcomed Trump's plan, considering it ""the first new idea in years.""

Since last January, Trump has been promoting the plan to displace the Palestinians of Gaza into neighboring countries, such as Egypt and Jordan, which was rejected by the two countries, and other Arab countries have joined them. Regional and international organizations.

** Eid for the Palestinians in the West Bank

Smotrich touched on the Israeli aggression on the occupied West Bank, and said: ""The residents of Judea and Samaria (the Hebrew name of the West Bank) must know that if they continue to terrorism, their fate will be like the fate of Gaza.""

And boasting about the extermination committed by Israel in the Strip, he continued, threatening: “Tulkarm and Jenin (northern West Bank) like Jabalia and Shuja’ia (in the Gaza Strip) will look. Nablus and Ramallah (in the West Bank) will look like Rafah and Khan Yunis (south of Gaza), and you will also turn into unpleasant ruins For housing, their residents will have to migrate and search for a new life in other countries. ""

He added: ""We will work to apply Israeli sovereignty to Judea and Samaria, and thus we have finally buried the danger of establishing a Palestinian state in the heart of Israel and strengthened the Israeli security belt.""

Since last January, the military operation that the Israeli army began continuing with a aggression consumed in the city of Jenin, its camp and towns in their vicinity, killing 25 Palestinians, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.

Then the Israeli army expanded its aggression to the city of Tulkarm on the 27th of the same month, where 5 Palestinians were killed. While on February 2, another operation began in the town of Tamoun and the Al -Fara'a camp in Tubas Governorate, to withdraw 7 days after Tamoun, and continues his operation in the Al -Fara'a camp.

The Israeli occupation army also continues for the second consecutive day its military operation in Nour Shams Camp (North), which killed 3 Palestinians and wounded others on Sunday, according to the Ministry of Health.",PS
"In addition, the consequences of the ""Al -Aqsa Flood"" operation on October 7 were hidden and disastrous and only led to killing children and women, intimidating and displacing the safe, this operation was like an earthquake that has its highly dangerous spoofing secretions on the Palestinians and Arabs in general from the Gulf to the ocean, and what is the invitation The displacement that US President Donald Trump stated in a moment in which the investment sense of real estate overwhelmed the sense The diplomat and the human dimension in which the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu agreed with him in the deal of its law, “I agree with you, so he agreed with me in that,” except one of these bad spoofing secretions on the Palestinians and the Arab peoples that may excel in their horror, size and effects of the first catastrophe, and therefore the call for displacement The Palestinians are condemned by the Arabs, as is the war that was launched on Gaza after the foolish flood adventure, which left only backward The destruction and misery, and the world has only shown the policy of the measures and the fait accompli that the politicians of the Western world deal with the Palestinian affairs.
The reality of the Arab -Palestinian conflict confirms that every Palestinian detail has the ability to mobilize to stand by the side Palestinian brothers to establish their free independent state, but does the policy adopted from the current American administration justify the entire Arab states and dignity in the face of the United States of America? Isn't it sufficient for what the Palestinians and Arabs have suffered from the loss of lands and losses in lives and money? In my estimation, whoever pays the strengthening of such a trend are those who were involved in igniting the unequal war between the Palestinians and Israel, and I mean explicitly the phrase this ruling is the axis And he told her when Iraq was presented to him on a plate of gold after the adventure of the late Saddam Hussein's foolishness in invading Kuwait and igniting an unequal confrontation Against the United States of America.
We do not shed the process of displacing the Palestinians and the political approach behind it, as they are condemned by the Arab peoples and from the legitimate Arab countries, especially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and from some countries that have prevailed in principle humanitarian positions and international legitimacy over the blind subordination of America the head of the Western camp, but, however we have to We mention that the waving of this The process is not new to the Palestinians, as it is an Israeli -international practical step that always followed any war between the Palestinians and the Israelis and its cost is high on the work of rebuilding what was destroyed and returned the displaced to their homes, and it is also a policy that Israel pursues against the Palestinians with the lands of the land despite the calls of Arabs and international agencies to reject Such a stressful policy of human feelings and the antagonism of every Arab -Israeli negotiation, and for this let us consider the displacement as an Israeli policy and as a result of whims The wars that were implicated by the axis of the ""resistance"" Arab countries.
The call for displacement, unfortunately, pledged this time to support and support President Donald Trump, hitting the wall with all international covenants and laws, and with all treaties that created a bit of peace between Israel, Egypt, the Palestinians and Jordanians through the Camp David and Wadi Araba agreement, and there is no surprise in this matter; This is because President Trump's denying and constant readiness to throw agreements and treaties in the garbage basket.
Here he is ready, and even in an effort to sell NATO, which his country leads only because he did not meet with European governments. The members of the alliance to increase the percentage of participation in European defense budgets, and here he sells Ukraine also if it does not intend and put its precious resources under American behavior, these only two example Dalan are on President Trump's positions on the agreements, and his willingness to ensure America's interest to sacrifice everything, and we should not forget All positions are changing by Trump if he sees a service for American interests.
Israel's threat to displacement will remain continuous, and America will not stop standing by its side in everything that it deems to achieve the interest of Israel, without paying attention to the consequences of that for the Palestinians. As soon as Trump announced his intention to displace the Palestinians to establish investment projects in Gaza, the Arab diplomatic reaction that rejects the displacement process was ready, especially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which I gathered to respond to by searching for an alternative to the displacement process, so Israel seized the opportunity of Trump's declaration and decided to establish a ""voluntary immigration agency"" to facilitate the process Immigration for those wishing to be citizens of Gaza. In my opinion, those wishing to migrate have been many under the rule of ""Hamas"" to Gaza, and this is what the coming days will prove. Accordingly, the treatment of forced displacement and voluntary migration The proposed dependent on the Palestinian side believing in the peace process that leads to the establishment of the Palestinian state alongside Israel and is able to bear the responsibility for preserving security and stability, and not ""Hamas"" is certainly the authority concerned with this; Because her agenda is linked in its depth to an ideology that sees the homelands ""a handful of dust"", and with foreign parties, the Palestinian issue has nothing but a bright slogan that shines its image among the naive Arabs.
There is no solution to the Palestinian issue except by adopting the principle of peaceful coexistence between the Palestinians and Israelis through a two -state solution, a solution that will never be achieved as long as we remain on a hostility with the United States of America. It is an explicit announcement of a hostility to America; This is because America alone has the keys to resolving the Palestinian issue, despite what Iran and its axis marketed from false promises to a coming military victory that we have only seen from death and displacement that received non -Palestinians.",BH

To the right to self -determination of the Palestinian people, and exposing the region to more wars
Conflicts that may threaten global security and stability. As for the fifth of these risks, it is a violation
The ceasefire agreement and the resumption of war again, which follows all the strenuous efforts
The brokers made it to reach this agreement, and exposes the lives of thousands of children and women to danger
Again, including the prisoners
Israelis
It also puts the Trump administration in front of its responsibilities. Sixth
These risks are a war crime and a crime against Humanity; Because it means ethnic purification against the safe population, as stipulated in the provisions of international humanitarian law.
In a related context, that
What Trump did contradict what he had previously announced that he would end wars, and that it is
He will be a peacemaker, and he will bring stability and prosperity to the region and the world. And the question
Here: Is the displacement of the Palestinians from their land, their removal from their homeland, and their conversion to refugees in
Other countries, will the stability that he talked about? Or will it lead to the outbreak of a war, not relentless
In it? Is this Trump's election promises to Arab, Muslim and Latin communities
For a vote for him?
Trump's scheme this
It is a new idea, and it is a continuation of the Abrahamic agreements, which is the second part of it
It was time to implement it, and Trump had previously taken into account a small ""area of ??Israel"", and he said: ""The lands of Israel must be expanded."" And the pillars of his administration repeatedly
Repeated to include the West Bank, and they denied the existence of a people called the people of Palestine. Later, he spoke
Trump on Gaza said; ""It is an exciting place and has a wonderful location and a beautiful climate, must
Removal them in a different way. ”All of these introductions and statements express an intersection
Trump plan With the goals of the extreme Israeli right, represented by Tamar Bin Ghafir and Smotrich,
Netanyahu adopted it.
What has failed Netanyahu
In achieving militarily through the war of extermination on Gaza; As a result of the resistance resistance and the stability of the people
Gaza and root them with their land and homeland; Trump wants to achieve it with political and diplomatic pressure
The economist, and so Trump does not seem to hold the responsibility of the world, but rather a real estate and investor developer
It works for the state of the Zionist entity.
On the other hand, and while
It failed to achieve the war of the Zionist fascist-American fascist
Residential neighborhoods, systematic destruction of infrastructure and various aspects of life and spreading epidemics
Diseases, starvation and thirst, killing about 50 thousand, most of them children and women, and about 112
A thousand injured, and more than 10 thousand missing and thousands of civilian detainees with the aim of forced displacement, then
The new trambling plan will definitely fail, although the scenarios of this plan, its introductions and pavements are numerous;
From obstructing the completion of the exchange deal, in preparation for the resumption of the extermination war, or the obstruction of the reconstruction
Gaza, the exertion of pressure on Jordan and Egypt, and other obstacles and obstacles.
Glory is used to the scene, there is no displacement plan Their return and no war defeated their will, they are joyful and their enemies are angry to see them returning, while their dusty faces rise in the smile of challenge and aggression, and their eyes are full of hope and insistence on a life they deserve on this land.
On the other hand,
The Jordanian Foreign Minister declares, saying; ""The solution to the Palestinian issue is a Palestinian solution
Jordan is for Jordanians, Palestine for the Palestinians, and the Egyptian Foreign Ministry rejected, ""prejudice
With the rights of the Palestinian people and refused to displace it, ""it is an Arab official response to Trump's plan.
As for the real popular response, the return of hundreds of thousands of displaced people was the crawl of Hadir who had never been
An analogy from the south to north of Gaza via Rashid Street on foot, and insisting to reach
Their destroyed places and their streets filled with potholes and knees, and to the facilities whose features have changed;
They rush the steps to the ruins of their homes, and some of them make it cheerle
His destroyed house, a lot of boys and women carry a ""bunch"" of return, and some
The other chose the roof of his collapsed house to harbor his family under him, and another looking for wood boards
And the branches of the trees to the rest of the house, and others re -reconstruct parts of their homes from
The remains of the rubble and the rubble And furniture.
You are used to
The Gazans, the scene, there is no plan to displace their return and no war defeats their will, they are happy
Their enemies are angry to see them returning, while their dusty faces rise with the smile of challenge and aggression,
Their eyes are full of hope and insistence on a life they deserve on this land.
This is their challenge and their response
On ancient and new displacement plans, the plan of generals, Nazi wars, and all of the mourners,
And they pledged to their conversations and dialogues under the flag of the homeland, there will be no other calamity, and this is only
The return of a minor waiting for the great return and the liberation of all of Palestine, and they swore that they will not leave the sands of Gaza,
They leave its martyrs, destruction, rubble, ruins, beach and beautiful climate; It is them
And for their children and their grandchildren after them.

Amid an official Egyptian rejection and the army's objection, some speculate about the scenario that Sisi might resort to to stop Trump's plans, or reduce its effects.
""Reviving the Brotherhood's scarecrow""
Observers expect Sisi to resort to the ""scarecrow"" of the Brotherhood to push Trump to refrain from his decision; They see that it may resort to intimidating the republican administration that the return of the Brotherhood, which may receive popular acceptance and popular and Arab support now, is a threat to the existence of Israel and the interests of America in the Middle East.
They also pointed to the possibility that the Egyptian administration will pressure in the same context to the army's rejection of a plan Displacement, and that this rejection of the army leaders may converge with any possible movement against the displacement and a popular revolution led by the Brotherhood, a possibility that Israeli press reports speculated.

""Trump's insistence and Sisi fears""
And last Tuesday, and after a meeting he gathered with the King of Jordan Abdullah II, Trump returned to his insistence on implementing the plan of forcibly displacement of Gaza residents, and their resettlement in Egypt and Jordan, and his country's control of Gaza without financial compensation, what Egypt met by announcing the features of the perception of the reconstruction of Gaza, with the survival The Palestinian people are at home.
Egyptian sources told ""Reuters"" that the Egyptian proposal includes the formation of a Palestinian committee to rule the Gaza Strip without the participation of Hamas and international cooperation In the reconstruction without the displacement of the Palestinians, in addition to moving towards a two -state solution.
The confirmed Israeli analyzes continue that the displacement plan is harmful to the Sisi regime, and that its fears of transferring the Palestinians to the Sinai lands may be killed in the entire regime, stressing the need to maintain Sisi’s rule, stressing that his alternative may be the rule of the Muslim Brotherhood.
In this context, in an article for the Hebrew newspaper ""Israel Hume"", the Israeli writer Shahr Kliman confirmed that Egypt is afraid to enter into a state of war with Israel; The fact that every defeat in the war fate of overthrowing the regime, explaining that ""its more fearful fear of the transfer of the Gazans to Sinai is the conversion of the peninsula into a skirmishes with Israel that explodes such a war.""

The political analyst and expert in the American affairs explained that ""therefore, when Washington's former Israeli ambassador, Michael Orn, was asked about the situation, he said that he expected to say that the American administration should accept the Egyptian refusal to displace the Palestinians, because exerting more pressure can come with the Brotherhood.""
Al -Satabi added: ""I do not know if that will happen, and if it will lead to a result in this case, there is nothing wrong."" It is expected that ""the conservative Republicans help their position are strong against the Islamists in general, which makes their use in this case more understandable and more effective "".

On July 14, the Egyptian journalist Qutb al -Arabi indicated that the Brotherhood’s scarecrow was used in Egypt, the Emirates and even France, in an article published by “Arabi 21”, entitled “What does it mean to summon the Brotherhood’s scarecrow again?!”
Al -Arabi pointed out that the leader of the extreme right, Marine Le Pen, used the Brotherhood's scarecrow in the recent French elections to tickle the voter feelings and vowed to close the Brotherhood and Salafists mosques in France.
He suggested that ""after the outbreak of the Battle of the Flood of Al -Aqsa, Maariv newspaper (now the role of Israel came to eliminate the Brotherhood), and similar words were reported on the tongues of leaders and politicians.""
He explained that ""in the UAE a new tour of the Brotherhood began to issue heavy judgments in what was known as the case (Emirates 84), which included a large number of symbols and leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood, ""noting that"" this phobia is not limited to the Emirates, but rather moved to other Gulf countries. ""
He stressed that ""in Egypt, an intensive multi -platform campaign was launched against the Brotherhood, whether in the media of the Egyptian regime or in the Emirates media, and whether through channels, broadcasts, newspapers or electronic sites.""

In his general vision of the Egyptian position in front of the American insistence, Palestinian researcher Salahuddin Al -Awawdeh told Arabi 21: ""In general, the United States sees in Egypt the most important ally in the Arab region after the usurping entity, and therefore it will not give up this ally easily.""
He added: ""Especially that it is not fundamentally different with it on any issue, including forced displacement and the need to eliminate the resistance.

The petition carried demands: ""Translating the Arab consensus into urgent and fast decisions that include tangible steps and the use of all the means of pressure available to prevent any attempt to impose a reality New in Gaza, ""and"" immediate and urgent work to completely stop the aggression, break the siege and open the Gaza Strip crossings.

The statements of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio highlight the escalation of Israeli-American plans to reshape the Middle East region according to extremist visions.

A book, political analysts, specialists and university professors believe in separate conversations with ""?"", that the meeting that was held between Netanyahu and Rubio comes within the framework of support The unlimited American of Israel, where he revealed strategic consensus aimed at strengthening Israeli aggression through plans that include displacement of Palestinians, including parts of the West Bank, and attempts to impose new policies on neighboring Arab countries.

The writers, analysts, specialists, and university professors indicate that these developments come in light of the current American administration's endeavor to restore Israeli domination, which was subjected to major tremors after the events of October 2023, and that American support for Israel exceeds the political and military dimensions, to include providing advanced weapons and supporting the policies of the far -right, What enhances the escalation climate in the region, in return this strategy is used to enhance the position of the president's administration The American internally by winning the support of extremist religious currents supporting Israel.

They expect US pressure to weaken the axis of resistance and thwart any efforts to reach a fair political solution, which makes The region is in front of an explosive scene dominated by force accounts and international alliances interests, especially the United States of America and Israel.

Unprecedented American support for Israel politically and militarily

The writer and political analyst Dr. Ahmed Rafik Awad believes that the current American administration, headed by President Donald Trump, is working to enhance Israeli aggression in an unprecedented way, through tremendous political, military and security support.

Awad notes that this administration adopts Trump's vision, which is centered on the displacement of Gaza population and the annexation of the occupied West Bank, in addition to the coercive control of the region without Israel paying any price for that.

Awad explains that the American administration is working to rebuild the reputation and the deterrent power of Israel, which was subjected to great strikes after the events of October 7, 2023.

Israel, according to Awad, has lost its prestige and functional role in the region, and the American administration is now working on compensating it for all of this by providing the necessary political and military support.

Awad states that the Trump administration has provided Israel with advanced types of weapons, including bombs capable of penetrating the ""mother of bombs"", which enhances its military capabilities in a way. big.

Awad notes that the American administration is working to drop the two -state solution, and forcing Egypt and Jordan to bear the burdens of the Israeli occupation, stressing that this unprecedented American support makes Israel more aggressive and more dangerous to the region.

Awad touched on the role of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who described him as an extremist with a clear and explicit Christian vision.

Awad notes that, before assuming his current position, Rubio was known for his terrifying statements that reflect his full bias in Israel.

Awad confirms that Rubio now crosses, as Minister of Foreign Affairs, an extremist vision that supports Israeli aggression and defends the policies of the extreme right in Israel.

Awad explains that Rubio holds a huge and infinite support message to Israel, which comes within the framework of the influence of the extremist Christian lobby in the United States.

Awad believes that the current American administration is defending the vision of the far right of the Israeli right, which makes it adopt aggressive policies towards the region.

Awad cited the statements of Rubio, which claims that the world would be better if Israel was the main representative in the region, and he believes that these statements reflect a clear blindness and bias. Aggressive Israel.

Awad asserts that Israel is not a democratic state as promoted to it, but rather an aggressive state that has not passed a single year without waging a war against the surrounding countries.

It indicates that Israel is not technologically or politically advanced as it claims, but rather a country facing internal and external problems that exceed the ones facing other countries in the region, and that Israel is not a state of well -being, but rather a country that suffers from major economic, social and political problems.

Awad notes that Israeli leaders are pursued in international courts, and that the Security Council, the United Nations and the Human Rights Council issued dozens of decisions against Israel because of its violations of human rights and its massacres against the Palestinian people, and that Israel struck all the surrounding countries, making it an aggressive state with distinction.
Awad believes that the American administration is not only targeting Iran, but also seeks to control Syria and make decisions in it, in addition to controlling the Red Sea and Palestine.

Netanyahu's statements are in harmony with the ""Termbi"" speech

Dr. Raed Abu Badawiya, professor of international law and international relations at the Arab American League, said that the recent statements made by the Prime Minister The Israeli Benjamin Netanyahu, and the clear harmony he showed with US President Donald Trump, came within the framework of Trump's appeal, after he appeared as a more extremist and Zionist figure than Netanyahu himself, which prompted the latter to make statements in harmony with the strict ""Termbe"" speech towards the issue of Israeli prisoners and detainees and the issue of displacement .

Abu Badawi notes that the press conference held by Netanyahu with the US Secretary of State came as part of this strategy, as Netanyahu sought to show his harmony with Trump in front of the right -wing Israeli street, and to deliver them to the existence of joint plans between the two countries.

These statements, according to Abu Badawiya, were an attempt to enhance Israeli popular mobilization, and confirm that Netanyahu is no less extreme than Trump in supporting Israeli interests.

Abu Badawiya believes that Trump's recent statements regarding the Middle East, and his interest in regional issues were essentially political exercises aimed at achieving the maximum American and Israeli interests. Through extremist statements, Trump sought to mobilize international and regional support to achieve Israel's goals, especially with regard to the issue The displacement of the Palestinians to Egypt And Jordan.

These maneuvers, according to Abu Badawiya, were also aimed at holding Arab countries the costs of the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, and thus removing responsibility for Israel, which was the main reason for the destruction of the Strip.

Abu Badawi notes that the other goal of these maneuvers is to involve the Arab countries in managing and governing the Gaza Strip after the war of genocide, which reduces the burden on Israel and pushes the Arabs to assume great political and financial responsibilities.

Abu Badawiya indicates that the Arab countries have already started responding to these pressures, as Arab initiatives that support the reconstruction and management of the sector have emerged, but these initiatives may not necessarily be compatible with the vision of Trump and Netanyahu, but rather a Palestinian demand as well.

Abu Badawiya asserts that any change in the Middle East according to the American and Israeli vision cannot take place without ignoring the Palestinian issue, not only in the Gaza Strip, but also in the West Bank.

Abu Badawiya expects that the coming days will witness an American position in support of the annexation of parts of the West Bank, both partial or total, which reflects the continuation of the extremist policies of Israel and Treb.

Abu Badawiya notes that the end of the Palestinian division It has become an urgent necessity to miss Trump and Netanyahu to achieve their goals.

And he affirms that the Arab pressures on the Palestinians to end the division must take place according to a Palestinian vision, and not according to an Israeli or American vision.

Abu Badawiya believes that the new Middle East ranking starts from the interests of Israel and America, which seeks to weaken the anti -Zionist axis in the region.

Abu Badawiya expects that the coming period will witness American and Israeli attempts to weaken Iran and its influence in the region, without resorting to military force, but rather through diplomatic pressures and political understandings.

He believes that the Russian -American summit between Putin and Trump may have an impact on changing regional equations in favor of Israel and America.

Abu Badawi asks the success of the American and Israeli vision in changing the Middle East, especially in light of the continued Palestinian -Israeli conflict and the failure to end the Palestinian division.

Abu Badawiya notes that Arab normalization with Israel may not continue in light of the situation in the West Bank and the war of genocide in Gaza, which will achieve the achievement of American and Israeli goals in the region.

Netanyahu's ambitions and adopting the Trump administration His aggressive policies

The journalist writer Nabhan Khreisha explains that the hopes expressed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by achieving achievements will change the face of the entire Middle East, stressing that Israel is coming to ""victories that we have not dreamed of before"", reflecting Netanyahu's broad aspirations that depend on the adoption of the administration of the US President Donald Trump for Israel's aggressive policies towards the Palestinians and the region in general.

Palestinian, Khreisha believes that Netanyahu is working with Trump to implement a plan aimed at displacing the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, and establishing what is called ""Rivera Gaza"", where Netanyahu described this plan during his press conference with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio as ""the only plan that can ""To achieve this goal, Netanyahu urges Trump to force Egypt and Jordan to settle the displaced from Gaza, as well as displacement West Bank residents later.

Khreisha notes that Israel has old plans related to Gaza, including the ""Ben Gurion Channel"" project, which dates back to 1963, as this channel, which was aimed at linking Eilat on the Red Sea to Gaza on the Mediterranean, was a substitute for the Suez Canal after its closure In front of Israeli navigation during the era of Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, the project faced geographical difficulties due to the survival of the Gaza Strip outside Israeli control, but if Trump's plan is implemented to seize the Strip, 100 km of the planned channel will be shortened, in addition to benefiting from fields Oil and gas in the land and sea of ??Gaza.

Khreisha confirms that changing the face of the Middle East for Netanyahu also means thwarting the dream of the Palestinians by establishing an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, by separating the West Bank from the Strip after the displacement of its residents, and imposing full or partial Israeli sovereignty on the West Bank with unlimited American support, according to government plans The Israeli right headed by Netanyahu.

On the regional level, Khreisha believes that Netanyahu is seeking to weaken Hezbollah's military and political power, through a series of assassinations that affected his leaders, and to limit his role as a key player in Lebanese politics. The Assad regime in Syria and Iran's loss of two main pillars on the borders of Israel pave the way for a new Middle East without influence Iranian.

Khreisha notes that ""the new Middle East Netanyahu"" can only be achieved by hitting the Iranian nuclear and missile capabilities, which requires American participation in any possible military attack, and that Netanyahu is counting on reaching the normalization of relations with Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries, in a way that guarantees dominance Israeli economic on the region, its natural sources and markets.

As for the statements of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said that the presence of countries like Israel in the region will make the world better, it reflects, according to Khreisha, the state of harmony and harmony between the Trump administration and Israel, and this contradicts the expectations of some that Trump's policies in his second term will differ from its predecessor, It seems that American support for Israel will continue to achieve its regional goals.

Clear agreements between Trump and Netanyahu on sensitive issues

Journalist Dr. Mahmoud Al -Faroukh said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is well aware of the nature of the statements he makes on changing the face of the Middle East, based on the results of his multiple meetings in Washington, especially those that he gathered with US President Donald Trump and his extremist republican administration.

This is amazing The meetings, according to Al -Farakh, resulted in clear consensus between the two parties on sensitive regional issues, including the position on the Palestinian issue and the rights of the Palestinian people.

Al -Farakh notes that during his visit to Washington, Netanyahu obtained American support to achieve several strategic goals, including the restructuring of Lebanon as a country free from Hezbollah, which is considered a threat to Israeli security from the northern side, and it was agreed to redraw the map of Syria in a way that ensures the reduction of the influence of the axis Resistance and resistance in the region, while maintaining the Israeli presence in some Syrian regions, especially the occupied Golan Heights.

It indicates that the Israeli -American consensus also included pushing the wheel of normalization with new Arab countries, in the context of what is known as ""Ibrahimi agreements"", with a special focus on normalization with Saudi Arabia, and it is believed that there is an understanding about the possibility of Israel to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, which is a goal Tel Aviv has been seeking for decades.

Al -Farakh is likely that the large bombs that have arrived in Israel may have been part of the preparations for this strike, which aims to weaken Iranian influence in the region and to reshape the Middle East. According to an Israeli American vision.

Al -Farakh affirms that Netanyahu's recent statements, especially during his meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, reveal a clear and continuous coordination between the Trump administration and the Netanyahu government in various regional issues, and among these issues is the file of the Gaza Strip, where the statements indicated the necessity of eliminating Hamas and ensuring that not The sector governs the future, with an emphasis on the importance of the return of Israeli prisoners, and thus, Israel seeks to achieve its vision of Gaza Without a weapon, without enthusiasm, and without resistance, as part of its project to reshape the Middle East.

Regarding the issue of the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, Al -Farakh believes that there is an American -Israeli consensus on the need to implement this plan, whether through forced or voluntary migration, but the positions of Jordan and Egypt, supported by major Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia, may constitute an obstacle to this plan, What may lead Israel to focus on achieving another goal, which is Gaza without enthusiasm.

Al -Farakh says: “The statements of Marco Rubio, the opposite Republican deputy and affiliated with the evangelical current supporting Israel, reveal the true face of successive American administrations, which compete in support The protection of Israel, as these statements confirm the Zionist lobby control over the United States ’foreign policy, reflecting the continuation of the strategic alliance between Washington and Tel Aviv in achieving their common goals in the region.

Extremist visions aim to blow up previous efforts related to the Palestinian situation

A professor of political and international sciences, d. Amjad Bashkar, that the recent visit of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to Israel, and the statements made during his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, are an important event that comes in a very sensitive period.

Bashkar notes that these statements, which talked about changing the face of the Middle East, carry deep strategic dimensions, as the Arab and Islamic world is intended to be the party that is being changed, while the United States and Israel lead this change process.

Bashkar notes that Rubio's statements reflect the extremist visions of the Israelis, especially the biblical current, which aims to blow up all the previous efforts related to the Palestinian situation, and even the abolition of the regional agreements that Israel signed with some Arab countries, including state allies United in the region.

These statements, according to Bakkar, show that the current American administration adopts an extremist discourse that ignores even moderate visions within Israel itself.

Bashkar confirms that Netanyahu and Rubio's statements come within the framework of reviving the ""New Middle East"" project, a project that is in line with American and Israeli visions aimed at strengthening normalization agreements, especially ""Ibrahim Conventions"", as the aim of this project is to make geopolitical changes in the region, with A special targeting of Egypt and Jordan, as the United States and Israel seek to reshape the political map of the Middle East.

Bashkar explains that Netanyahu is betting on exploiting the presence of the Trump administration to achieve Israel's strategic goals, which have not been achieved since 1948, as Israel and the United States are working in parallel to change the Middle East, not only through geopolitical changes, but also by trying to make changes in government systems in Arab countries, including Lebanon, Syria, Egypt and Jordan.

Bashkar notes that Rubio's statements, in which he praised the superiority of Israel in the region, reflects the unlimited American support of Israel, which is prepared As ""State 51"" for the United States.

These statements, according to Bakkar, aim to promote normalization with Israel and impose it as a role model in the Middle East, regardless of the crimes they commit against the Palestinians and its repeated violations of international law.
Bashkar affirms that Rubio's statements are an implicit condemnation of every country that does not adopt the Israeli approach, which reflects the continued American pursuit of the Middle East in favor of Israel.
These statements, according to Bakkar, show that Israel is in a state of euphoria with the presence of the Trump administration, as it seeks to achieve its expansion and domination goals on the region, with strategic strikes to Iran.
Bashkar affirms that the statements of Rubio and Netanyahu reflect the continuation of American and Israeli efforts to change the Middle East, by pressuring allies and opponents to enhance Israel's position, however, these efforts face great challenges in light of the Arab and Islamic popular rejection of Israeli domination, and its repeated violations of human rights and international law.
Bashkar believes that the current US administration, with its closer formation of the Israeli right, believes that any defeat for Israel is a strategic defeat For the United States of America in the Middle East, so it puts all its weight in favor of Israel in all fields.

The claim that the existence of Israel makes the world better contradict the facts

The writer and political analyst Samer Anabtawi indicates that the American and Israeli plans aimed at changing the face of the Middle East are not new but continuing, despite the difficulties and obstacles, but Donald Trump's arrival to power in the United States gave a strong boost to these plans, as Netanyahu found in Trump a strategic ally that helps him In achieving the major goals of Israel in the region.

Anabtawi confirms that the agreement between Netanyahu and Tremb started before the American elections, when Netanyahu visited the US Congress and announced his support for Trump, which strengthened the relationship between the two parties, and the primary goal of this alliance was to change the map of the Middle East, and to redistribute geographical and political roles in the region, and this plan includes Receiving the Iranian role, weakening the role of resistance, and tampering with the Palestinian interior through the displacement policies, which he insists on Netanyahu greatly.

Anabtawi notes that Netanyahu's meeting with the US Secretary of State came within the framework of this The goals, as Israel seeks to impose its hegemony on the region through two main projects: the first is the ""Ibrahimi Project"" that aims to enhance normalization between Israel and the Arab countries, and the second is the policy of displacement that aims to empty the West Bank of its residents and annex it, all of this is under an umbrella The American -Israeli consensus to create a new Middle East serves the interests of both parties.

Anabawi explains that Trump is seeking to reshape the Middle East according to his vision, as he wants Israel to be the dominant power in the region.

Anabtawi notes that the statements of the US Secretary of State about the presence of ""more countries like Israel"" in the region are serious statements, as the presence of one country like Israel was the cause of bloodshed and instability in the Middle East, and if there were more countries like it, the region would have sink In a sea of ??blood.

Anabtawi confirms that Israel is an artificial state, which has been created to serve the goals of the United States and the West, whether at the ideological level or common interests, and it is present to expand at the expense of the peoples of the region, starting with the Palestinian people and reaching the rest of the Arab peoples.

Anabtawi stresses that the claim that existence Israel makes the world better is a claim that contradicts the facts, as Israel is the main reason for the violations of international law and the commission of massacres in the region, believing that the world will be better without Israel and its expansionist policies, and without the American hegemony that supports it.

Anabtawi notes that the global consensus on Israel's criticism of its repeated violations confirms that its existence is not a solution, but a source of problems and conflicts in the Middle East",PS
"Correspondent of the American TV Network (NBC) went to US President Donald Trump, during the joint press conference with Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, with a question about what is the authority of the United States on the Gaza Strip that allows it to displace its residents into neighboring countries?  He replied by the businessman, that the United States will remain responsible for Gaza in the long run, and this will lead to stability in this part of the Middle East, and he added: ""Many people who spoke with them admired the idea of ??the United States to have this plot of land (Gaza Strip ) And its development to create thousands of jobs in it. Everywhere, Netanyahu expressed his support for this idea, describing it as a ""original idea"" !!
Netanyahu will not hesitate to dedicate the Gaza Strip to Trump after the displacement of its residents from it (if it is able to do so), and if the pressures of the Trump administration resulted in Egypt and Jordan, to receive the displaced Palestinians, to establish resorts, hotels, casinos and for the white slave trade, but what will Netanyahu get in return? Netanyahu, with his approval to stop The shooting with Hamas and the exchange of prisoners with it, replaced the slogan ""absolute victory"" after his failure to achieve it with the slogan ""absolute barter"", and this was evident that he was exempt to the Mossad chiefs and the Shin Bet from the leadership of indirect negotiations with Hamas, and its support to the Minister of Strategic Affairs, Trump's friend ""Ron Dream"", It indicates the vision of Netanyahu for the next day in Gaza politically.
Netanyahu is spending Trump in exchange for Israel's commitment to the ceasefire in Gaza, and the completion of the second and third phases, by including the West Bank or parts of it to Israel, displacing what Israel can displace it from, and ensuring that the United States does not support the establishment of a Palestinian state during the Trump administration negotiations with Saudi Arabia to normalize its relations with Israel, in addition to Israel obtaining American military and political support, to attack Iran to eliminate its armament capabilities and its program Nuclear.
Netanyahu also senses the danger of his disintegration of his government, in light of the position of his right -wing ally Smotrich, who threatens to demolish the temple of the Israeli government at the head of those in it, if the war does not continue on Gaza, and he also feels the risk of the end of his political future, in light of his great decline in the decline of his popularity. in Opinion polls, although he agreed to the ceasefire of the prisoner exchange. Therefore, Netanyahu sees in Trump a sacrifice for him by implementing what he promised regarding Gaza and the West Bank, and in other files related to the Middle East serving the interests of Israel, which will compensate him for the image of the failed in the war on Gaza, to appear in the form of strategic gains for Esratil, and this will serve him in staying In the ruling on if the extremist minister, Smotrich, carried out his threat to withdraw from the government, as well as to increase his popularity in Among the Israeli voters, which have declined, as recently showed in Israeli polls in Israel, despite his approval of the ceasefire, and the retrieval of Israeli prisoners from Gaza.
Trump's statements regarding the announcement of Israeli sovereignty on the West Bank or parts of it are conflicting, as he implicitly indicated in his statements before Netanyahu's visit to the White House, to support him included the West Bank by saying that the area of ??Israel is very small compared to the areas In his hand, we compared him to the area of ??the office he was sitting on. However, he announced during the joint press conference with Netanyahu, in response to a question whether he confesses With Israeli sovereignty on the West Bank by saying, ""We will discuss this with the representatives of Israel, and people love this idea, but we have not yet taken a position, and we will issue a declaration in this regard during the next four weeks."" He added, ""I do not say anything about two states, no one country, or about The lack of a state. ""
At the same press conference, in response to a question about whether it is possible to reach a normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia without establishing a Palestinian state, Netanyahu said, ""Saudi Arabia will help, it wants peace in the Middle East."" ""I think that peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia is not only possible, but will happen,"" he added. However, the response of Saudi Arabia was not late regarding the uprooting of the Palestinians from Gaza and the annexation of the West Bank of Israel, as it stated in a statement by the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ""The Kingdom refuses to uproot the Palestinians from their land, nor will it establish relations with Israel without the establishment of the Palestinian state, and that this position is not subject to To negotiate. ""
In response to Trump's statements regarding the ""purification"" of Gaza from the Palestinians, and the imposition of Israeli sovereignty on the West Bank, the Egyptian and Jordanian response came refusing this, for reasons related to defending the right of the Palestinians to live in Their homeland is in an independent state, and because these plans threaten the national security of both countries, as the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced in a statement that Egypt's rejection of any prejudice to the rights of the Palestinian people, whether through settlement or annexation of the land or by evacuating that land from its owners, through displacement, Whether it is temporary or long -term, while Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Al -Safadi announced Jordan's refusal to any attempt to displace the Palestinians, and that it will not accept any solution to the Palestinian issue at the expense of Jordan.
The positions of the American administration on the Palestinian people regarding the next day of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank (and if they do not crystallize more clearly), but these positions indicate that Israel and the United States believe that the Palestinian people are an excessive people over humanity, and they are trying to delete them, ignoring their successes in The failure of dozens of liquidation attempts since 1948, and its design, provided that its fate is not like the fate of the Red Indians, for example, so its number today reaches To 13 million people, half of them in the homeland, and the other half in the exile, and he is still insisting on returning and establishing an independent state, which confirms the impossibility of blurring his existence, and that American and Israeli plans are nothing but ""plowing in the sea"".",PS
"What the occupied entity failed in the war of extermination, Trump seeks with a rude and rude political pressure.

In full swing, the new American administration continues to blow up the red line for the displacement of the Palestinians, this happens in light of an official Egyptian -Jordanian reluctance, and a massive rejection.


The American President reaffirmed the necessity of obtaining Egyptian Jordanian approval of the decision to displace Palestinians from Gaza to the two countries, and directly alluded to aid provided by America to Cairo and Amman calling for ""the return of the favor""!

In the American insisting on displacement, what calls for the belief that there are arrangements between Israel and the Trump administration, and that the latter pledged to achieve what the Zionist destruction machine failed.

A new and difficult battle in front of the two official systems in Egypt and Jordan, it needs official and popular efforts, and with very accurate political accounts in order to come up with the best possible results.

Historically displacement

The idea of ??displacing Palestinians into other countries is not new, but rather a ""scenario"" has been constantly proposed over the past decades.

Attempts to liquidate the Palestinian issue have never stopped for many years, this is a fact confirmed by history.

History certificates also reveal The ingestion of historical Palestine began originally by the displacement meal in 1948.

At that time, the Palestinians were displaced from their lands, and calls for some international circles appeared to settle Palestinian refugees in neighboring countries such as Lebanon and Syria.

The cursed idea was repeated a lot over the years in light of the crises facing the Palestinian issue, but it has always been facing it with a categorical rejection from the targeted countries, and a real confrontation with it from the Arab peoples.

Before leaving his position as President of the United States of America in 2020, Donald Trump re -raised similar ideas known at the time as the ""deal of the century"".

In the leaks published by the media at the time, the desire for displacement was clear in the suspicious Trump deal, as the American president saw that removing the Palestinians from Gaza is one of the most important solutions to the Palestinian issue, and that the displacement may be a means of folding the open page of conflict for decades!

In the leaks at the time, there was something that suggests that Egypt choose a possible destination to receive the Palestinians in the event of the implementation of this malicious plan.

With official anxiety and popular anger, the idea did not find great international support, and important steps did not move forward.

Trump ended his mandate The first is the “deal of the century”, and in the second he returned to the call to displacement without winding, rotation, or maneuvers of any kind.

The first failed, and the second will fail!

An Egyptian refused its causes

Until now, the Egyptian rejection seemed to the official and popular levels clear and not hesitant.

Inside the official institutions, a heritage of confronting attempts to displacement, and frequent formulas to reject the suspicious project.

Official Egypt believes that the idea of ??displacement of Palestinians will have great negative repercussions at several levels, locally and regional.

In politics accounts, it is not possible to accept that history writes that the liquidation of the Palestinian issue began with Egyptian hands.

On the international level, Egypt- as a fundamental supporter of Palestinian rights- will find itself in a difficult position in front of the Arab and Islamic world, if he hesitated to reject all formulas of displacement.

The Arab and Islamic Ocean views the Egyptian state as a major support for the Palestinian right throughout history and since the catastrophe of the occupation.

This political dimension in my estimation is the most important in the Egyptian rejection of displacement, and it precedes all of the reasons that some market, and are related to the expected economic effects if the American -Zionist goal is achieved.

if We added political and moral rejection to liquidate the Palestinian issue in an Egyptian hand to other legitimate concerns related to Egyptian national security, because the Egyptian refusal becomes logical, strong, fixed and legitimate.

Confronting the political and popular displacement

Going to the Arab world and addressing the Arab peoples is a necessity that should not be left or neglected. All projects of displacement and liquidation of the issue can bring the Arab peoples to drop with one blow.

In front of the regime in Egypt, an opportunity to expand the angle of vision and address the peoples of Arab countries to be a party in the face of the imposed by the new old colonialism, and it is sponsored by an American president who only believes in force.

The official Arab silence so far on what Donald Trump has offered it is strange and incomprehensible, but it is certain that the positions of the Shiites of the Shiites are clear and do not make a mistake.

Certainly, Egypt's position is popular and officially was clear and firm in refusing to displace the Palestinian brothers outside their lands.

This rejection requires other important steps, related to preparing the Egyptian home front for a confrontation that may be difficult and extended to a time that does not know its extent except God.

The required steps

In the absence of serious, real, and unanitable popular support, it cannot Betting the steadfastness of the Egyptian regime alone in the face of strong, strong storms coming from an American president who manages politics with the logic of ""merchants"" and with the arrogance of old colonialism.

The first steps required are to reunite the divided society, and to stop the sharp polarization formulas that started about ten years ago.

In major national issues, political differences can be excluded temporarily, and to cooperate in the spirit of one team, while each party retains its point of view and its position in political work.

Egypt needs an open public field that brings together all national spectrums, and melts it in the category of total and decisive rejection of the calls for displacement and the threats that national security faces.

The release of prisoners of opinion and the start of a new page at the age of the homeland seems necessary in a new stage that started from the age of the Egyptian state.

It is not possible to separate a strong and unified internal front, end all formulas of domination and domination on public work and close its field.

Confronting the malicious ideas coming from Trump and Israel should not depend on the ruling regime, but rather that it must go beyond it to a broad popular rejection with the participation of real and influential political forces.

In this cohesion, a certain defeat for all suspicious projects that fell in The past, it can be dropped again.",QA

Adnan Al -Sabah: It is required to build a front that begins with our unity and ends with the unity of the Arab and Islamic positions in the face of American and Zionist projects

In light of the dangerous escalation in the West Bank, especially in Jenin camp, after dozens of homes were detonated in a scene that mimics the war of genocide in the Gaza Strip, fears arise about the expansion of the arc of fire in the rest of the West Bank, in the context of Israeli policies that seek to pass expansion plans.

A book, political analysts, specialists, and university professors believe in conversations Separate with ""?"", that Israel is trying to compensate for its failure to achieve its goals during the recent war on the Gaza Strip, as it seeks to export the image of ""victory"" in the West Bank to satisfy the extreme right and religious Zionism, and at the same time, these policies aim to restore the lost Israeli prestige In front of the Palestinians, and prevent them from addressing the plans of annexation and Judaization that threaten the future of the Palestinian issue, and even implement the plans and control of parallel With displacement.

And they point out that Israel, with the support of the American administration, is working to draw phased plans aimed at liquidating the Palestinian issue by imposing unfair settlement solutions based on military power and political coercion.

They confirm that the only way to confront these challenges is the unity of the Palestinian ranks and the end of the internal division, and the development of a national struggle program agreed upon by all forces and factions, in addition to strengthening alliances with Arabs, Muslims and international allies as a necessary step to confront Israeli and American attempts to impose unfair solutions, without observing historical rights And patriotism for the Palestinians.

Political goals and deeper strategy

The writer and political analyst d. Ahmed Rafik Awad that, in light of the recent Israeli escalation in the Jenin camp, which witnessed the demolition of residential squares and widespread destruction, the possibility of expanding the ""Arc of Fire"" in the West Bank is very high.
Awad is due to the multiplicity and diversity of the goals of the current Israeli government, which is not limited to what you call ""fighting terrorist structure"" or cutting Iranian financing and influence, but rather goes beyond this into a deeper political and strategic goals.

Awad notes that the Israeli government seeks to achieve goals that exceed the advertiser, after Israel succeeded in imposing a ban on UNRWA, now aimed at hitting Palestinian camps, emptying them from their residents, and reshaping their geography, and this includes the demolition of homes, streets, and the expulsion of the population Partial or total, and these steps are not random, but rather are part of a broader strategy that aims to weaken existence Palestinian in these areas.

Awad believes that the Israeli Minister of War, Yisrael Katz, seeks to present himself as a strong and firm minister of war, which may lead him to invent new goals to keep the conflict burning, and these goals may not be real, but rather a way to satisfy the Israeli right and distract the public from issues The Interior, such as the potential Gaza Agreement.

Awad believes that the expansion of the arc of fire in the West Bank may be a substitute for the resumption of the war in the Gaza Strip, especially in light of a possible American rejection of a new escalation there, and that any normalization process with the Arab countries requires stopping the war in Gaza, which leads Israel to transform the focus of the conflict To the West Bank.

Awad notes that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seeks to keep the conflict burning to avoid the disintegration of his government and postpone trials and elections, and that the Israeli right wants to establish the inclusion of the West Bank in part or completely, and the current war serves this agenda.

And he confirms that the goals of the Israeli war are multiple and varied, including what is internal and some of them are external, inner, the government seeks to satisfy the public and the extreme right, and provide a political ""bribe"" by replacing the ceasefire in Gaza with a war in the West Bank, while externally, Israel aims To weaken, surround the Palestinian Authority, and drop the two -state solution.

Awad notes that Netanyahu wants to achieve an easy victory in the West Bank, in addition to the declared goals such as ""uprooting terrorism"" and drying Iranian financing, but the war Currently serve deeper and more complex goals.

In the face of this escalation, Awad believes that the Palestinian Authority should change its relationship with Israel, even if this requires radical steps.

Awad stresses the necessity of achieving a real national unity between Fatah and Hamas, to block the way for Israel, which plays on the Palestinian internal contradictions.

Awad stresses the importance of tireless work by the Palestinian Authority to besiege and stripped the occupation, in addition to forming Arab and international fronts to pressure Israel to stop its aggression.

And he confirms that the Arab role, especially the Saudi role, must be clear and decisive in rejecting normalization with Israel without stopping the war and settlement, and without achieving the Palestinian state on the minimum borders.

Awad believes that the international pressure, especially by the United States, is the key to the solution to stop this massacre in Gaza and the West Bank, calling on Saudi Arabia, as a major regional power, to pressure Washington to achieve this goal, so normalization with Israel must be conditional on stopping the aggression and achieving a fair peace for the people Palestinian.

Eliminate Palestinian camps

The writer and political analyst Firas Yaghi confirms that what the West Bank camps are witnessing, on top Jenin camp, from systematic demolitions and destruction of homes and infrastructure, falls within the framework of a new Israeli policy aimed at rearranging the security situation in the West Bank, especially in the post -seventh stage of October 2023.

Yaghi explains that this policy focuses on eliminating Palestinian camps, not only in Jenin, but in all parts of the West Bank, in an attempt to impose a new demographic and geographical reality that serves the interests of the occupation.

Yaghi notes that more than 100 homes in Jenin camp were fully destroyed in the context of these operations that exceed that they are mere military measures to be part of a strategic plan to gradually displace the residents of the camps, and this comes in parallel with Israeli decisions such as stopping the work of the Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees. (UNRWA) and the legislation issued by the Israeli Knesset that seeks to undermine the legal status of Palestinian refugees, what It shows a clear desire to dismantle the camps and displace their residents.

He believes that Israel is trying to reshape the geographical structure of the camps, pointing to what happened through the incision of wide roads inside and around the Jenin camp, with the aim of facilitating the operations of storming the camp at any time And reducing the population density inside it, which may lead to the displacement of the population voluntarily or forcibly.

According to Yyghi, this trend is linked to the auctions between the military and security leadership in Israel, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seeks to enhance his political position by making prominent concessions and roles of currents such as the religious Zionism led by Bamtalil Smotrich, who seeks to impose full Israeli sovereignty on the West Bank by 2025.

Yaghi notes that the Israeli army is trying to confirm its ability to impose security and control of the West Bank independently of any partnership with the Palestinian security forces, which reflects a trend towards undermining the role of the Palestinian Authority and systematically weakening it.

Yaghi notes that the Israeli military operations have expanded to include new areas such as the Al -Far'a camp, Sumoun and Tulkarm, in a move aimed at imposing comprehensive control on the West Bank and devoting an irreversible occupation.

Yaghi confirms that Israel views the West Bank from two main perspectives: the first is security, by virtue of its geographical proximity to the heart of Israel and its overlap with the major Israeli cities, and the second is religious, given that the West Bank contains religious sites Historically, Israel considers part of the ""biblical symbols"", and for this reason, Israel sees that the West Bank is more strategically important than the Gaza Strip.

Yaghi notes that the policy of ""expanding the arc of fire"" in the West Bank, which is currently adopted by Israel, is not just a security plan but part of a long -term strategy aimed at establishing a wide network of barriers and iron gates - exceeding 900 barriers - to restrict the movement of the Palestinians and push them towards Forced migration.

He believes that this restriction is part of the policy of ""voluntary displacement"" that Israel pursues to empty the land from its indigenous population.

Yaghi asserts that these practices come in the context of preparing for broader political plans, which include imposing a new reality on the ground even if the establishment of a future Palestinian state, Israel seeks to ensure full security control over this country, while undermining its actual sovereignty and denying it the ability to manage its internal affairs freely .

Yaghi stresses the need for the international and Arab community to move, especially the American administration, to pressure Israel to stop these policies.

Yaghi shows his pessimism from the feasibility of this move in light of the positions of the American administration led by Donald Trump, which he considered as a ""green light"" for Israel to continue its settlement and Judaization policy.

Yaghi asserts that the continuation of these policies will lead to the imposition of new facts on the ground, even if Trump's plans are rejected by the Palestinian leadership and people, because Israel is continuing to implement its settlement agenda regardless of any international opposition.

The reproduction of the aggression on Gaza

The Israeli affairs specialist, Fayez Abbas, believes that the destruction and demolition of the Israeli occupation forces, and the demolition of homes and infrastructure and imposing a siege on hospitals in the northern West Bank, especially in Jenin camp, is very similar to the policy implemented in the Gaza Strip, but the only difference is the amount of explosives That Israel is dropping on the heads of citizens in the West Bank compared to Gaza.

According to Abbas, more than six months ago, Israel was threatening to launch military operations in the northern West Bank, especially after the hysteria that hit the inhabitants of the Israeli border areas adjacent to the West Bank.

Abbas indicates that these threats came as a result of continuous warnings from the residents of these areas, who live in constant concern about the possibility of repeating a scenario similar to ""October 7 Events"" on The border with cities such as Jenin, Qalqilya and Tulkarm.

Abbas explains that the main goal of these operations is to deter, and to prevent any armed operations that may start from the West Bank towards the territories occupied in 1948.

Abbas notes that publishing pictures of Palestinian youth in Jenin on social media, with slogans of jihad and resistance, was one of the reasons that prompted Israel to continue its military operations after the ceasefire in Gaza.

In addition to deterrence, Abbas indicates that there are political reasons behind these operations, the most important of which is the satisfaction of the Israeli Finance Minister of Smotrich, who dreams of fully dreamed of the West Bank.

Abbas affirms that the recent decisions to close Palestinian cities and impose military barriers on the roads used by the Palestinians, in addition to searching Palestinian cars systematically, aimed at turning the lives of the Palestinians into ""hell on the roads.""

Abbas notes that Israel has installed signs on the roads carrying clear messages, such as ""there is no future for the Palestinians here"", in an attempt to consolidate the idea that the West Bank is an Israeli land.

Abbas explains that the Palestinian National Authority tried to prevent these operations by gathering Weapons and protection of youth by arresting them and moving them to safer places.

But these attempts, according to Abbas, have not succeeded in stopping bloodshed or preventing the destruction of Israel.
It indicates that the Palestinian security services, despite their efforts, were unable to achieve any success in the face of this intense military campaign.

Abbas believes that it was possible to link what is happening in Jenin to the ceasefire in Gaza, which could open the door for a political deal that stopped the escalation in the West Bank, questioning the possibility of achieving this in the coming period, especially as Israel continues to implement its expansion and political agenda in the West Bank .

Israel seeks to achieve a ""victory"" image in the West Bank

The professor of political media at Hebron University, Saeed Shaheen, warns that Israel is trying to pass its expansion plans in the West Bank under the pretext of combating what it calls ""Iran's claws"", in an attempt to compensate for its failure to achieve its goals during the recent genocide war on the Gaza Strip.

Shaheen confirms that Israel is seeking to achieve a ""victory"" image in the West Bank to satisfy the extremist right and religious Zionism, and to restore its prestige and the power of deterrence lost in front of the Israelis. Likewise, preventing the Palestinians from addressing the annexation and expansion plans they seek.

Shaheen notes that Israel, after its catastrophic failure in Gaza, may resort to new massacres against the Palestinians in the West Bank, especially in light of the international silence applied and the failure of the Arab brothers.

Shaheen notes that the international community, especially the American administration, is directly involved in drawing Israeli plans for the next stage, which aims to liquidate the Palestinian issue by imposing unfair leveling solutions that depend on the employment of military force and political coercion.

Shaheen explains that Israel systematically seeks to eradicate the Palestinian resistance in the West Bank before its capabilities are strengthened, in order to prevent the repetition of the Gaza model, which has become an existential threat to the Israeli occupation state.

Shaheen confirms that the expansion of the Israeli occupation is the scope of aggressive attacks in the West Bank aims to pave the way to implement the plans of the Israeli right leaders, aimed at swallowing the areas of ""C"" and parts of ""B"" areas in the West Bank, weakening the Palestinian National Authority, and perhaps completely dropped it as a step towards undermining any Hope to establish an independent Palestinian state.

And tightening Shaheen is that the only way to confront these plans is the unity of the Palestinian ranks and the end of the internal division, and the development of a national struggle program agreed upon by all Palestinian forces, factions and political movements.

Shaheen stresses the necessity of arranging the Palestinian house internally, and going towards Arab and Muslim brothers, in addition to the international allies, to form a strong alliance capable of confronting Israeli and American attempts to impose unfair solutions on the Palestinian people.

It is believed that any solutions imposed on one side, without observing the historical and national rights of the Palestinians, will be governed by failure, calling for strengthening popular and diplomatic resistance in the face of the policies of displacement and annexation that Israel pursues with the support of its international allies.

Intensive efforts to change the facts on the ground in the northern West Bank

The writer and political analyst Samer Anbatawi confirms that the Israeli occupation is making extensive efforts to change the facts on the ground in the northern West Bank, with a special focus on the Palestinian camps that Israel considers a foci of resistance, due to its high population density and its population that hinders the military occupation operations and makes it The confrontation is more difficult.

Anabtawi explains that these camps are not only a military challenge to the occupation, but also considered a witness to the catastrophe in 1948, which the occupation seeks to obliterate it through systematic attempts to eliminate the features of asylum and forced displacement.

Anabtawi notes that this policy coincides with the attempts of the occupation to isolate the UNRWA (UNRWA) and dry the sources of international aid provided to Palestinian refugees, with the aim of liquidating the refugee issue and canceling the right of return, within the framework of a broader project aimed at ending the Palestinian people's issue from its roots.

Anabtawi notes that the Jenin camp is an icon of the Palestinian resistance, as since the 2002 battle, a symbol of steadfastness and challenge has remained in the face of the occupation, despite the great losses incurred by the occupation army there.

Anabtawi notes that the solidity of the Palestinian factions and the resistance in Jenin camp made him a safe haven for resistance in the West Bank, which prompted the occupation to take harsh aggressive military measures to empty it from the resistance elements.

Anabtawi shows that the occupation has made systematic plans to expand its military operations against the Palestinian camps gradually, as it turns This war little by little to a large -scale attack targeting the entire West Bank.

According to Anbawi, this escalation comes in the context of the appointment of a new general for the Israeli army chiefs of staff, who has extensive experience in the suppression of the Palestinian people, which enhances the ferocity of military operations in the West Bank.

Anabtawi points out that this escalation is associated with unlimited support from the settlers, and in its essence aims to impose the actual policy of the Palestinian lands and try to displace the Palestinians forcibly or voluntarily, as Israel seeks to force neighboring countries, such as Egypt and Jordan, to receive Palestinian refugees, based on statements US President Donald Trump, in which he explicitly called for the displacement of Palestinians to these countries.

He explains that Israel is racing against time to impose a new reality on the ground, considering that the events that took place on October 7, 2023 are a historical opportunity to tighten its control on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and work to empty the sector from its residents, in preparation for imposing more pressure on neighboring countries.

Anabtawi criticizes the state of Arab and Islamic silence regarding these Israeli policies, warning of the absence of real international positions capable of confronting This dangerous scheme.

He affirms that confronting this project requires strengthening the steadfastness of the Palestinian people, supporting their internal unity, and ending the state of the Palestinian division that weakens the ability of the Palestinians to address the plans of the occupation.

Anabtawi stresses the necessity of forming a unified Palestinian front, which adopts a clear and agreed national program, expressing a unified Palestinian voice capable of influencing and reviving the support of the Arab and Islamic worlds.

Anabtawi calls on the countries surrounding Palestine to take decisive positions to protect its national security in light of the displacement of the Palestinians to it, considering that the Zionist project does not target Palestine alone, but rather threatens the stability of the entire region.

An extension of a comprehensive war that started in the Gaza Strip

The writer and political analyst Adnan Al -Sabah confirms that the Israeli aggression on the West Bank is not just a passing military operation, but rather an extension of a comprehensive war that started in the Gaza Strip and is now gradually and systematically transferred to the West Bank.

Al -Sabah explains that the occupation is implementing a clear -cut plan aimed at eliminating the Palestinian presence in the West Bank through the demolition of homes, committing massacres and dismantling the social structure. And the demographic of the Palestinians.

Al -Sabah indicates that the Israeli occupation army explicitly announced the political level that there is no longer what can be done in the Gaza Strip after the recent military escalation, which means that the main destination now is the West Bank, where the ""real war"" began on the ground, with the aim of full control of the West Bank And dismantling them to closed and separate linens and components from each other.

Al -Sabah explains that this policy is manifested through the laws enacted by the Israeli Knesset, such as the Law of the Right to possess the settlers in the West Bank, and the law to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, and the abolition of the Sharon 2005 law to break the link with Gaza and the northern West Bank, indicating that all these legislations are in the direction of converting The West Bank to a fully subject to Israeli control, as part of a long -term Zionist settlement project that seeks to obscure identity Palestinian and achieve strategic political goals.

Al -Sabah shows that the ultimate goal of this plan is to implement the Zionist project based on converting the West Bank into an integral part of ""Judea and Samaria"", according to the settlement biblical vision that seeks to fully Judaize the Palestinian land.

And see The morning is that the Palestinian people are considered the main obstacle to achieving this project, and therefore the occupation depends on multiple strategies to pressure the Palestinians, including internal displacement, economic and social restrictions, and prompted them to search for individual solutions outside their homeland under the continuous suffering.

Al -Sabah indicates that the United States plays a pivotal role in supporting this project, by caring for Israeli policies and providing the necessary political and diplomatic cover.

Al -Sabah notes that the statements of the occupation leaders, such as Bastel Smotrich, which put the Palestinians in front of the options ""departure, submission, or death"", clearly reflect the Israeli approach based on the imposition of the fait accompli by force.

Al -Sabah stresses that the only solution to confront this Israeli project lies in achieving Palestinian national unity, by building a unified nationalist national program that runs the struggle of the Palestinian people with one political leadership and a unified national consensus government.

Al -Sabah confirms that the Palestinian rank unit is the basis for facing Israeli and American plans, especially in light of

Attempts to liquidate the Palestinian issue through normalization agreements and political projects that It serves the occupation.
Al -Sabah calls for the construction of a wide Palestinian front to confront the ""Deal of the Century"" project and displacement plans, and to strengthen political alliances on the basis of common interests with neighboring countries, while stopping the policy of betrayal and internal division.

Al -Sabah stresses the importance of establishing a real dialogue with the Arab and Islamic countries to unify positions against Zionist and American projects that threaten the stability of the entire region.

Al -Sabah expresses his confidence that the scale will suggest for the benefit of the Palestinian people and the Arab world if Palestinian national unity is achieved and regional positions are unified, especially since the American and Israeli interests in the region are largely dependent on their relations with the Arab countries, indicating that the strengthening of this unified front will contribute to achieving The goals of the Palestinian people and preserving their national and historical rights.

Al -Sabah says: ""It must be emphasized that building a front begins with our unity and ends with the unity of the Arab and Islamic position in the face of American projects and Zionist projects is the basis for facing the plans of the Zionist movement.""",PS

In an unfamiliar development, mutual statements between Hamas and the American administration raised questions about the possibility of opening dialogue channels between the two parties. The beginning came with the statement of Hamas leader Musa Abu Marzouk, in a telephone interview with the New York Times, about the movement's willingness to dialogue with the United States, and even its willingness to receive an envoy from the administration of US President Donald Trump in the Gaza Strip while providing protection for him if necessary. Abu Marzouq considered that such a dialogue could help Washington to understand the feelings and aspirations of the Palestinians, which may lead to the adoption of a more balanced position that reflects the interests of all parties. On the American side, President Donald Trump's Special Envoy welcomed the Middle East, Steve Witkeov, with these statements, saying: ""I think it is good if it is accurate,"" indicating the possibility of exploring this step without a clear commitment. These statements come at a time when the region is witnessing extensive efforts to calm the situation in the Gaza Strip after the ceasefire agreement entered into force. Press reports confirmed that the Trump administration I started working on the second stage of the agreement, which includes a ceasefire and the exchange of hostages between Israel and Hamas. These developments raise questions about whether this rapprochement reflects part of a broader American policy strategy in the Middle East, especially in light of the Trump administration's focus on unconventional transformations such as the normalization of relations between Israel and a number of Arab countries. Trump's desire to build a heritage as a ""peace maker"" may be an additional motivation to explore new communication channels even with parties such as Hamas, which Washington classifies as a terrorist organization since 1997. In the same context, Steve Witkeov announced that he will visit the region soon to participate in a team International monitors the commitment to the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip. In an interview with the American ""Fox News"" channel, Wittakouf revealed that the inspection team will focus on sensitive points, including the ""Netsarim"" corridor, which separates the north of the Strip from the south, and Salah al -Din (Philadelphi) border between Gaza and Egypt. He stressed that these areas will witness the presence of international supervisors to ensure that weapons or individuals with hostile intentions are not infiltrated, which represents the first public declaration with the participation of the United States in the field of monitoring the agreement. Being on the ground in the Gaza Strip, the American envoy praised Qatar's pivotal role in mediation, and mentioned in particular the skills of Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani in communicating with Hamas, describing his efforts as ""indispensable"" in the success of the agreement. Considering that there is a ""new feeling of leadership in the region.""  Qatar considered a model for countries that could play a greater role in enhancing regional stability here imposing questions, the most prominent of which is, will Qatar enter the normalization line followed by providing a path to contain Hamas in regional deals that are now?  Will Qatar require recognition of the Palestinian state as a condition for the Israeli -Qatari normalization? Will Hamas agree to join the new club? What will Hamas offer in return? What are the concessions that you will make? What about the PLO? Why did Hamas resort to dialogue with the United States before dialogue with the PLO, which is the organization, I mean the legitimate representative of the Palestinians?
Despite this initial openness, any possible dialogue between the two parties faces great obstacles. The American classification of Hamas as a terrorist organization is a legal and political barrier in front of any official communication, along with sensitivities Regional, which several countries may see in this rapprochement a threat to their interests or policies towards the Palestinian issue. The position of Israel, the main ally of the United States in the region, may oppose any dialogue between Washington and Hamas. For its part, Hamas may seek to improve its international image by showing openness to the dialogue, in an attempt to reduce regional and international pressure on it. Also, the entry of regional parties, such as Türkiye, may contribute to playing the role of mediator to push this initiative. The main question remains whether these statements are an actual start to open direct or indirect communication channels between Hamas and Washington, or is it just a tactical maneuver on both sides? At the present time, it appears that the American interest is limited to achieving a phased progress related to the ceasefire and ensuring stability, without clear commitment to broader steps. What is happening may reflect a limited shift or political maneuver with phased goals. But achieving concrete progress requires overcoming political and legal obstacles, and providing international support and regional guarantees that Türkiye or other parties may play an important role in it. In the same context, US President Donald Trump's statements about the chances of re -re - The reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, and its affirmation that Gaza has great potential, beautiful weather and promising investment opportunities, raising many questions about the nature of the upcoming American role in the Strip. These statements seem to provide a more economic vision than political, which opens the way for questions about whether the Trump administration is dealing with the Palestinian issue, including the conflict in Gaza, with a purely real estate investment perspective, away from the political and human dimensions. Trump's approach to talking about Gaza as an investment area that reflects his personal style that distinguished him as a businessman and real estate developer before entering the world of politics. This vision may reflect a desire to use economic motivation as a tool to achieve stability and calm the situation in the sector, which is part of a broader approach that was adopted during the ""Deal of the Century"" plan, which focused on improving economic conditions as an alternative to traditional political solutions.
However, this ""economic"" view of the conflict may face great obstacles. The conflict in Gaza is not just a issue of development or investment, but rather a complex political conflict related to the Israeli occupation, the blockade imposed on the Strip and the rights of the Palestinians. Ignore the political and radical dimensions of the crisis, The focus only on reconstruction and investment projects, may lead to superficial solutions that do not address the essence of the issue. On the other hand, Trump's statements may be an attempt to present a new approach in dealing with Gaza, inspired by his experiences in the field of business. However, this approach may face resistance from the regional and international parties that see in the Palestinian issue a matter of political and historical dimensions that cannot be simplified to just an economic opportunity.
If this approach reflects Trump's vision of the conflict, it may be seen as an attempt to change the rules of the game by focusing on economic interests instead of seeking fair political solutions. The challenges facing any American investment role in Gaza will be great, especially in light of the continued Israeli blockade and the internal Palestinian division.
It remains that these statements, despite its economic nature, may indicate an American strategy that seeks to normalize or ""bomber"" of the conflict, by providing Gaza as a more investment opportunity than a political issue. However, it remains unclear whether this vision is able to achieve concrete results on Earth, or is it just another reflection of the Trump approach that mixes politics and the business world. I believe without a unified Palestinian vision and plan, we will be part of the plans of others that will be imposed on us.
The next four years are a kiss with Trump's surprises and his team, and they have taught the belt.",PS
"Positive decisions are followed by the new US administration against the regime

For the White House, he made dozens of negative decisions towards Washington's friends and commercial competitors, contrary to what he made towards Cairo.
Days after Trump, Egypt, was excluded from his decision to stop foreign aid to many countries on January 27, the ""Defense Security Cooperation"" agency affiliated to the US Department of Defense ""Pentagon"" announced on Tuesday that he agreed to sell defensive systems to Egypt by about 929 million dollar.

The first of these variables; Trump's invitation on January 25 to displace 1.5 million Palestinians to Egypt and Jordan, and his assertion more than once that Cairo and Oman, who expressed the rejection of his plan, will accept it.
Washington announced the military deal, despite the announcement

From its inhabitants.
The deal also comes at a time when she indicated There are many Western and Arab press reports that the Egyptian army rejected the Trump plan, amid fears of its consequences for the Egyptian national security and the future of the Sinai Peninsula.

Israeli Benjamin Netanyahu last Tuesday, that his country ""will take over"" the Gaza Strip, declaring that he does not rule out the sending of American forces ""to secure US ownership"" there.

Rather, the American military armament deal for Egypt, which was attributed by the American statement to help improve the security of a friendly country, remains an important force for political stability and economic growth in the Middle East; It comes in light of the preparations for the Israeli army for forcibly evacuating Gaza, while the occupation of the Salah al -Din axis has continued since last May, despite the announcement of a truce with the Palestinian resistance last month.

""Presses and does not stimulate""
Bakr believes that ""Trump does not need to motivate Cairo or Jordan to accept his plan, because he previously received Sisi's approval of the deal, and his assertion that he and the king of Jordan will accept the plan of displacement that means secret understandings between America and Israel on the one hand, and Egypt and Jordan on the other hand on the plan, though Data and media rejoicing.

"American President Tramsbbstegament's decision caused American international aid a deep shock due to the devastating effects that may affect millions of people in basic areas such as anti -AIDS, children's education in Uganda and the support of flood victims in South Sudan.
As soon as he signed the presidential decree after his inauguration, the US President decided to suspend all external assistance programs for a period of three months, excelling the emergency nutritional aid and military aid to both Israel and Egypt.
During this period, the Trump administration will review the entire international aid system, with the aim of ensuring its compliance with the policy of ""America First"", a step that has been raising a great concern from the poorest countries.
Despite the possibility of resuming aid after the expiry of the deadline, human activists warn of long -term repercussions of its interruption, while some experts believe that this decision may harm the credibility of the United States permanently, at a time when countries such as China seek to increase their influence in the developing world.
Peter Weissa, a member of the ""Compacton Concontis"" network on humanitarian aid in Uganda, noted that just a few days of stopping medicines may It leads to catastrophic consequences, adding that the interruption of medicines for people with AIDS for a short period may threaten their lives.
He also explained that some schools supported by the American ""Education for All"" program informed the students in advance of not attending the classes in light of the cessation of funding.
In southern Sudan, where the cholera epidemic strikes and floods overwhelmed large areas, leaving thousands of homeless people, Trump's decision raises additional concerns.
James Akon Akot, a teacher in an orphanage in the northern city of Awel, said that the lack of a rapid decline in the decision may actually lead to deaths due to hunger and diseases, wondering about the fate of immediate relief and reconstruction projects.
The United States has long been the largest source of development aid globally, granting approximately $ 64 billion in 2023. It is among its most important programs ""Pepar"" launched by former President George W. Bush to combat AIDS, as more than twenty million people with a virus benefit directly from it Human immunity.
Although this program apparently survived the generalization of the decision of the new American administration, thanks to the exceptions granted by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to include ""assistance The emergency food and ""life -saving aid"" such as the distribution of AIDS drugs, the unclear formulation still sends wide doubts.
Nurse Suzy Dzimbery in Malawi indicated that local population began storing available medicines, and that the local ""Lithass"" organization, which was distributing AIDS drugs, closed its doors.
In Washington, a parliamentary assistance in Congress affirmed the file of humanitarian aid that the directives are still blurry, and that even a short interruption may threaten a huge store of ready -made drugs.
She said that the initiative known as ""Pippar"" was tantamount to ""an American Marshall's plan"", noting that stopping it with a sudden decision gives the impression that the United States is not actually causing, and may lead developing countries to rely on other forces such as China in the future.
Upon signing the latest exemptions this week, Rubio stressed that the administration does not want to see people die, but he stressed that the aid benefits will have to justify their expenses, saying that cooperation in the past was limited, and that the support of support with the American ""national interest"" must be guaranteed.
On the other hand, some in Washington believe that granting priority to aid ""The emergency"" is a broader plan to stop all other types of financing. A senior official of an American organization, who preferred not to be named, stated that cutting aid is primarily targeting local groups that lack reserve financial resources, which are specifically what American officials wanted to support him.",FR
"The current US President, Donald Trump, is unprecedented in his international policy, which is not based on solid rules, a state of instability and tensions in international relations, even within the United States itself. His sudden and unexpected decisions weaken traditional institutional mechanisms, raising questions about the future of the world order.

In other words, ""tramp"" is a challenge to stability and the loss of ability to predict international relations.
In the last three decades, this chaotic scene became more clear, threatening and weakened the traditional balance of powers.

Traditional international institutions have declined to major power strategies, led by the United States, which seeks to enhance their dominance by exploiting or creating global crises, to get out of their own economic crisis.

With the absence of effective alternatives to balance, the international system remains fragile and more vulnerable to chaos, which raises a major question: Does the problem lie in America's strength or in the weakness of the world?

Washington has strengthened its power on the back of two global wars, through the economy at the beginning, then by military power and technology later. What led to changes In global balances, these operations are still continuing today with the emergence of a ""trambling"" situation, which helps to emerge crises and tensions around the world.

Today, the European Union faces great challenges in light of the internal crises, political tensions and divisions between member states. This situation leads to a decline in its effect as a force in the international system. Despite France and Germany's efforts to preserve the unity of the Union, economic challenges and regional conflicts, especially the Russian -Ukrainian war, as well as the rise of the right in Europe, threaten the stability of the European Union.

The Poland presidency of the European Union Council in 2025 is facing many challenges. Despite the general consensus of Ukraine's support, there are clear divisions on the sanctions imposed on Russia, and the possibility of ending the war through a settlement that the United States may propose, and it may be more surprising than its proposals regarding the deportation of the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip ""Trumpfire"". Moreover, Europe's weakness in addressing major international issues, such as the Palestinian issue, enhances doubts about its ability to be a major player on the world stage.

Under These transformations, the Arab world faces increasing challenges, as external interventions, especially the American, have exacerbated the divisions and poor stability. Washington has followed the policy of weakening the Arab countries by supporting selective alliances, and ignoring fair solutions to disputes, foremost of which is the Palestinian issue. Conflicts are continuing in Yemen, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Syria and Lebanon, which deepens the divisions and weakens the representation of the Arab world on the international scene. In this context, strengthening regional cooperation and redefining political strategies towards major powers becomes very important.

The new world that America seeks, there is no place for any other party! What is the solution?

The trend towards more stability and promotion of development, and the exit from the state of global economic recession, it is necessary to reshape international alliances and enhance regional cooperation, as well as opening new horizons for cooperation with Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America. This shift may contribute to reducing dependence on the great powers, which gives all countries, including Arab countries, a greater opportunity to maneuver in regional and international issues, to preserve Global stability.

In this situation, the Israeli occupation continues its expansionist policies, supported by the US administration, through settlement and forced displacement, which increases the escalation of tensions.  Taking advantage of international standards and unconditional American support, Israel escaped from punishment. As expected, the return of the ""Trambeh"" policy to the White House increased pressure on the Palestinians, not the least of which is Trump's recent statements about the displacement of the Palestinians ""Trumpfire"" and the ""buying"" deals of the strange Gaza Strip, who? How? And when? What are the foundations? Questions remain without an answer, except that the region is coming at an unprecedented new escalation.

In the face of these challenges, the Palestinian leadership is working to enhance its diplomatic efforts, by strengthening and building new alliances with countries such as South Africa, the Group of 77 and China, and with Russia, Europe and some circles in the United States. International popular support for the Palestinian issue, which is evident in the protests against Israeli crimes, contributes to increasing pressure on governments to adopt more powerful positions towards the occupation.

The absence of effective Western pressure, and the bias of the American administration of Israel, allows Israel has an escalation of its policies without deterrence, which increases instability in the region. However, the policies of Prime Minister Netanyahu, which depends on confrontation and escalation, face increasing criticism even from his traditional allies, and contributed to increasing Israel's isolation on the international scene.

The first mandate of Trump (2017-2021) closed the doors to the Arab peace presented in 2002, in exchange for the ""normalization"" that the Trump administration, the Israeli derby, wanted ""free normalization"" between Israel and some Arab countries in 2019. The comprehensive chaos that exceeds the borders of the region, seems to be the borders of the region, What distinguishes the second term (2025-2028).

""Trambeh"" has absent the American Foundation at all levels, and the most dangerous attempts to jump on international legitimacy; The international system suffers from a state of clog, which leads to its transformations into a foggy reality characterized by explosive policies, unexpected transformations, and mixing of the leaves.

Netanyahu and Trump can claim their ownership of the entire world, and not only for Gaza, except that the American administration lacks a real impact on the Palestinians who have spread the ruins of their homes in Gaza, maintaining the most important thing they possess, their national identity, which is similar Certainly Gaza sand beads, they are not for sale or bargaining.

The conflict solution in the Middle East, including the recognition of an independent Palestinian state on the borders of June 4, 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital, remains a test of the international community's ability to achieve stability. The success of this solution not only affects the stability of the region, but also the future of the entire international system, and it may be a solution to the difficult economic crises faced by America.

The new international system requires reassessing the current alliances and building a multiple system based on equal partnership, rather than the dominance of major powers. The solution to regional conflicts, especially in the Middle East, the longest conflict in history, and the implementation of a two -state solution representing two essential elements in building a more stable and peaceful world.

The year 2025 may be a joint year in the reshaping of the international system. Either the world continues to drown in chaos and tensions, or that new mechanisms for cooperation and balance are developed that prevent the outbreak of a new global conflict.",PS
"For a intermittent second session, separated by a presidential session during which he sat in the White House former President Joe Biden, and in his four years Europe caught up with a continuous war to this day between Ukraine and Russia, in which the Zionist entity assaulted the Gaza Strip in a war that lasted 471 days, in which he exterminated the inhabitants of the sector , With the support of Washington, and the entity of the entity is cities in the West Bank and its villages, and Israel has launched aggression against Lebanon and Yemen And Syria, and set vital goals in Iran and Iraq, and in that period Sudan caught a civil war whose effects were not subjected to today.
That was a brief lighting for the four years of Biden, as things not only stopped at political effects, but also reached economic wars at times with China, and another with Russia, as well as economic wars with economically emerging countries with hidden and publicly.
Today, a different day, and in which he sits in the White House, a president, unlike the party to which Biden belongs, a president we have previously tried for a period Western, especially NATO, with Mexico and Canada Panah and South American countries, China and Iran.
After four years of break, we have to ask what is on Trump's agenda in his second term? What will he do? How does its political and economic team think? These are questions that we have found answers during the past few days, as it is said (the written reads from its title), and who followed the speech of the American President on the day of his inauguration, and whoever monitors his subsequent decisions, he feels certain that the White House master puts his eye in the first place, so contrary to his decision that relates to In gay people and only two types of human varieties, male and female, which is the only decision that found great support, while Other decisions found a division between supporters and exhibitions, especially those related to asylum seekers in the United States, births obtaining citizenship, and what is related to Canada, the island of Grenada, the Panama Channel, and the criminalization of supporters and sympathizers with the resistance.
As for the other prank, and what relates to the vision of the American President regarding the Middle East, and the right of the Palestinian people to an independent state, the man, according to his previous process in his first term, has not yet came to mention the right of the Palestinians in an independent state, and he did not talk about a vision to end the conflict in The region, but rather, showed - as usual - a complete bias of the Zionist entity, and perhaps his last decision to cancel a previous order from the Joe Biden administration to suspend the supply of the Israeli occupation with a kind of heavy bombs, indicating this.
The region in general, and the Middle East, in terms of allocation, will witness during the Trump period, and the duration of his presidency in its four years is sharp turns, and we have to be aware of it, and they are ready for each other, as the proverb says, whoever does not see from the sieve is blind, so the stage requires coordination between the states The region, leave the differences aside, and think seriously about strong alliances, similar to the Chinese -Russian -Iranian alliance The South American Indian, and like the alliance of Western European countries, therefore the countries of the region must take the opportunity and deal with it, form a serious alliance and a clear political and economic vision, and not to be dispersed and scattered.
The fixed truth that must be dealt with, that many countries in our region will be subjected to endless pressures by the new administration, and whoever believes that President Trump put his previous vision and the century's deal announced by his back alliance, he must rethink again, and put matters in its natural and real quorum, and this needs an effort A unified integration, and its introduction to the new American administration.

"The region is witnessing extensive diplomatic moves with Donald Trump's return to the White House and its last speech, as it seeks to rearrange the papers in the Middle East according to his biased vision of the domination policies and Israel in an unprecedented way. In this context, the tour of the Trump envoy to Saudi Arabia, Israel and Gaza, which carried multiple references on the future of the Palestinian issue, the position and status of the Palestinian National Authority, and the role of Saudi Arabia in drawing the features of the next stage alongside Egypt and Jordan that Trump threatened through the issue of displacement, though That the Palestinian and Jordanian position were clear in the face of this and its rejection completely, with the formation of a traveler on national rights and national security For brotherly Jordan.
The Trump administration is trying today to re -positioning its policy in the Middle East after fundamental changes that followed the first period of Trump's rule, in addition to the failed Biden administration and the partner with the aggression of extermination. Starting with the transfer of the American embassy to Jerusalem and its recognition as a capital, to the normalization agreements that were pushed under the name ""Abraham Conventions"", to his fascist national speech, and his recent decisions regarding settlements The settlers and the international judiciary, and his call to Netanyahu as the first official guest of the White House, the position of UNRWA and aid to our people, and in anticipating the rights of the peoples of the world and the threat of the sovereignty of their countries, under the slogan of the false and alleged ""stopping wars"".
Today, with the intensification of the crisis in Gaza and its repercussions after the aggression of the extermination, which is not sure that it does not continue after completing the stages of the deal, a tour comes as an attempt to re -control the diplomatic path according to a pure American agenda represented in:
1. Reopening the channels of communication with the Palestinians, according to American conditions that the PLO will not accept. The Wivkov meeting with one of the leaders of the PLO in Riyadh, ""as the Axios Media website, indicated, reflects Washington's desire for its frantic and rejected attempts to reintegrate the national authority within its plan, but on US -Israeli conditions. This meeting cannot be considered a positive shift as much as it is an American attempt to use the Palestinian National Authority as a negotiating card within the framework of new normalization plans, and perhaps in the scenarios of the post -war Gaza administration.

2. Enhancing the path of Saudi -Israeli normalization.
A meeting with Wifkov with the Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, comes as part of the ongoing efforts to pay a normalization agreement between Riyadh and Tel Aviv. But unlike the previous formulas, the American administration is trying this time to integrate the Palestinian issue in one way or another, either through ""promises of a path"", which may lead to a Palestinian state, of course, according to the American -Israeli concept of the state as geographical homes without sovereignty, or through new arrangements that include Gaza that may lead To a separate entity under the Israeli siege, or as Trump saw it as a tourism investment project that is monopolized by the major American billionaire companies.
Wivkov's visit to Gaza, the first of a twenty -year American official, is not just a diplomatic step, but rather it may be a prelude to imposing new solutions in line with the Israeli offering on the sector. With Trump's recent statements about the displacement of our Palestinian people, it cannot be excluded that this tour aims to test the settlement scenarios in order to repeat the Johnson project in the 1950s, which was then nationally dropped, or imposing a new administration on Gaza in isolation from the Palestine Liberation Organization, the owner of the political and legal mandate According to all international agreements and legitimacy, and away from Hamas or by sharing them as a fait accompli It is subject to renewal.
Saudi Arabia appears in these moves as a mediator between the Palestinians and the Israelis, but the main question remains, what does Riyadh want from this role?
I believe, Saudi Arabia seeks to achieve strategic gains from Washington, whether at the level of military support or security guarantees and economic cooperation, and ensuring its position in any political settlements, and therefore its role as an Arab player in determining the conditions of neighboring countries such as Lebanon and Syria, and regional and international gives it an important pressure card in Negotiations with the Trump administration. At the same time, Riyadh realizes that any step towards normalization needs an Arab cover, and for this you are trying to persuade the Palestinians to accept a new negotiating path, even if it is only with formal gains.
But in light of the Israeli -American trends, there is no intention to give the Palestinians any real rights, but rather formal concessions that do not affect the essence of the settlement occupation, and do not lead to the right to self -determination, which cannot be accepted Palestinian or even Jordanian.

The meeting between Wifkov and one of the Palestinian leaders reflects a clear fact, which is that the Palestinian Authority is facing a strategic predicament imposed by the United States, and perhaps the lack of a strategy Patriotism and adequate planning to confront this impasse. After years of estrangement with the Trump administration, the National Authority found itself in front of pressure to reopen the communication channels, but within American conditions, it is not in the interest of its national role and the interest of our Palestinian people.
In this context, attempts by some powers, led by Hamas, are highlighted to open a direct dialogue with Washington, according to the statements of its leaders, threatening the legitimate Palestinian representation unit, which constitutes a transgression of the role of the Palestine Liberation Organization, that it should be expanded through the duty of Hamas aware of its national role. Without strange agendas, and emphasizing them in practice as the legitimate and only representative of the Palestinian people. Any Palestinian-American dialogue must take place through the umbrella of the PLO, which undoubtedly requires the supreme national interest today to revitalize in accordance with democratic mechanisms, and elections by destiny and possible spaces, not through separate and unilateral channels expressed by one of the Hamas leaders, so that the Palestinian national decision is not exceeded The independent and the unified assumption, or the imposition of paths that contradict the supreme national interest of our people, the Americans are trying to impose on us.
At the same time, there are attempts to form a new administration of Gaza that may include Hamas in regional arrangements, which may be an alternative to the Palestinian National Authority in Gaza. This may be part of the American-Saudi pressure on the organization and the Palestinian Authority to accept their negotiating terms.
In light of these moves, we must reassess our strategies, and take a clear and strict position to prevent any liquidation of the Palestinian issue through:
1. Rejection of any normalization path that enshrines the occupation, must be pressured on Saudi Arabia and the Arab countries to link any normalization agreement with real Israeli concessions that lead to the embodiment of the sovereign and continuous state on the borders of before June 4, 67, and not just empty promises or flimsy paths.
2. Addressing any displacement projects in any formula, it is not possible to allow the reproduction of a new catastrophe under any justification, whether under the cover of ""development"", or ""reconstruction"".
3. Any Gaza administration rejected outside the framework of the PLO. Any political or administrative arrangements for Gaza must be part of an integrated national project, and not imposed from regional or international powers that seek to end the national project, provided that the organization can accommodate the Palestinian national urgently.
4. Implementing what was agreed upon in ""Beijing"", today it is a response to the demands of our people With the broad unity, which, in my opinion, is the best solution to get out of these crises by implementing what was agreed upon between the Palestinian factions, by forming a government of national consensus, whether it is a government of national unity or an internationally and regional acceptable government, according to a consensual political program in the PLO reference, which quickly needs to activate Its structures and role as a democratic national liberation movement.
5. Building new alliances outside the American -Israeli circle, so that the relationship with Israel is reformulated as an occupying power, according to the decisions of the Central Council of the organization, and the decisions of the national movement, including ""Fatah"", and a policy of relationship with the Americans boldly, according to the political interests and rights of our people. Relations with China, Russia, Latin America, African countries and other friends in the European Union must be invested to confront American pressure and create real diplomatic and economic alternatives.
6. Rearranging the Palestinian House on a clear consensual basis, our people and its political leadership cannot face these challenges without real national unity within the framework of the PLO with its position as a broad national front and a single legal actor, responding to the requirements of our people and friends around the world from During its supposed role since the speech of the founding martyr Yasser Arafat at the United Nations in 1974, and the international confessions that followed it, and from the position of our country in 2012, according to President Abu Mazen's speech to the United Nations, the position that must be completed towards a full -member state, and the continued isolation of Israel as a rogue state Crime crimes are committed.
Lebanese -American billionaire Etisalat Paul, one of Trump's close associates, the father of his son -in -law, a visit to Wifkov and his regional meetings, are not just diplomatic steps in light of Trump's representatives at the United Nations and Tel Aviv on the biblical right, but rather are part of a long struggle over the future of the Palestinian issue and subject our people. The Palestinian position must be cautious and ready for the political and diplomatic confrontation boldly to confront the requirements, with the ability to impose its conditions, instead of drifting behind false and secret promises. The real bet should be on the official integrated, Palestinian popular will, political resistance, diplomatic, legal and popular, investment of unprecedented international solidarity, our people's insistence on steadfastness, and building new alliances based on the Palestinian right, Arab and international, so defeat Not a destiny.

Any Palestinian-American dialogue must take place through the umbrella of the PLO, which undoubtedly requires the supreme national interest today to revitalize in accordance with democratic mechanisms, elections in the amount and possible spaces, not through separate and unilateral channels expressed by a Hamas leader.",PS
"Moussa Abu Marzouq, deputy head of the political bureau of ""Hamas"" abroad, which indicated the movement's readiness to communicate directly with Washington, raised many questions about the seriousness of this step and whether it represents a strategic shift in the ""Hamas"" policy, or is it just An attempt to improve its post -war international image in the Gaza Strip.

A book, political analysts, specialists, and university professors, in separate conversations with ""?"", believes that Abu Marzouk's statements may reflect Hamas's desire to search for legal legitimacy and international recognition, especially in light of its actual control over many aspects of life in Gaza, while they see This step may come within the framework of a new American policy under President Donald Trump, who seeks to leave a legacy as a peacemaker.

They point out that, however, the challenges are great for both parties, on the one hand, Hamas faces legal challenges as it is on the American terrorist list, in addition to fundamental issues, such as: recognition of Israel, rejecting violence and delivering weapons, and on the other hand, the American administration needs to Congress approves any steps related to opening a dialogue with ""Hamas"", and these obstacles make it difficult to predict The success of any future dialogue, in addition to the presence of Palestinian internal divisions and the lack of a national consensus on how to deal with these developments.

""Hamas"" desire to search for legal legitimacy and international recognition

The writer, political analyst and professor of international relations at the Arab American League, Dr. Amjad Abu Al -Ezz, believes that the willingness of the ""Hamas"" movement to open a dialogue with the United States reflects the movement's desire to search for legal legitimacy and international recognition, especially in light of its actual control over many aspects of life in Gaza Strip.

Abu El -Ezz explains that this step comes within the framework of a new era of American policy under the leadership of former President Donald Trump, who seeks to leave a legacy as a peacemaker.

Abu Al -Ezz notes that the United States started practical steps on the ground by sending security companies based on army forces and retired officers to the checkpoints in Natsarim, which indicates the need for understanding or initial agreements between the two parties that necessitated the opening of the dialogue.

Abu El -Ezz believes that ""Hamas"" wants to open communication lines with the United States in search of legal legitimacy, and it may be part of a regional deal through which the movement is contained through Certain understandings, such as avoiding war with Israel in exchange for allowing its representatives to participate in a government or any kind of agreements.

Abu Al -Ezz notes that Trump wants to deal with players on the ground, which opens the door to the possibility of opening a direct line between ""Hamas"" and the United States in the next stage, whether it is through tactical initiatives to enhance the truce and release the prisoners, or as part of a broader strategy To deal with the Middle East.

Abu Al -Ezz notes that the challenges are great for both parties. On the one hand, Hamas faces legal challenges as they are on the American terrorist list, in addition to major issues, such as recognition of Israel, rejecting violence and handing over weapons, which are issues that Hamas cannot make decisions regarding Easily, on the other hand, Trump needs Congress' approval of any steps related to opening a dialogue with ""Hamas"".

Abu El -Ezz explains that the experience of dialogue with the United States is not new for the Palestinians, as the PLO began dialogue with Washington in the 1970s, but this dialogue stopped because of Yasser Arafat's refusal to condemn some Palestinian operations, indicating that he is supposed to ""Hamas"" to learn from The organization's experience, but it faces great challenges in achieving a balance between its Palestinian project and its regional projects.

Abu Al -Ezz believes that Hamas must open a dialogue with the PLO to achieve a consensus on all points, including resistance and relations with Israel and neighboring countries, instead of searching for channels with the United States of America.

Abu El -Ezz stresses that any dialogue with the United States must be supported by a unified Palestinian legal umbrella, to avoid tactical exercises that may weaken Palestinians in the long run.

Abu Al -Ezz calls for a comprehensive national dialogue to implement national unity on the ground, to block the path of any plans and programs that may not be commensurate with the aspirations of the Palestinians and their legitimate political rights.

Abu Al -Ezz believes that President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) can play a pivotal role at this stage by offering an initiative for national dialogue that includes everyone, including the ""Hamas"" movement, which pulls the rug from under any channels of dialogue that is not in line with the national consensus.

Abu Al -Ezz warns that the reconstruction of Gaza with a purely economic perspective may ignore the political and radical dimensions of the Palestinian issue, which raises questions about the extent The ability of this dialogue to meet the legitimate rights of Palestinians without falling into any political trap.

""Hamas"" fell into a great wearing about a visit to Witkeov

The writer and political analyst Akram Atallah believes that the Hamas movement signed a great wear on Stephen Whitchov's visit, the American special envoy to President Donald Trump, to the Gaza Strip, where ""Hamas"" believed that Witkeov will visit Gaza at the head of an independent American delegation through a crossing Rafah or the Beit Hanoun crossing, without realizing that the visit will take place under the Israeli security and administrative cover, and that Israel will be organized For this visit.

Atallah notes that this confusion prompted Hamas to announce its willingness to secure protection for the American delegation, a statement followed by another statement by Musa Abu Marzouk, in which he confirmed the movement's readiness to open a dialogue with the United States of America, as these statements were built on a wrong assumption.

Atallah is not more likely that the United States of America can open a dialogue with Hamas, for several reasons, including the firm American decision to end the movement of the movement in Gaza, which is compatible with the Israeli position.

Atallah refers to tweets issued by US President Donald Trump And the American National Security Adviser, which emphasized that ""there is no place for armed organizations in Gaza"", and called for ""the skin of Gaza and its rebuilding.""

These statements, according to Atallah, reflect a match in the American and Israeli vision regarding the necessity of ending the role of ""Hamas"" as an armed resistance movement.

Atallah confirms that ""Hamas"" will face great difficulties even if the United States opens a dialogue with it, because the American conditions will be inconsistent with the nature and composition Hamas as an Islamic resistance movement.

Atallah explains that the ""Hamas"" movement has been resisting the occupation, and if the United States stripped it of its weapon, it will take it off the justification of its primary existence.

Atallah notes that the recent statements of ""Hamas"" regarding its willingness to dialogue with the United States came as a result of a wrong assumption, as the movement believed that the American envoy would arrive in Gaza through the Egyptian Rafah crossing, without realizing that the visit would take place under the mantle of the Israeli occupation.

Atallah believes that ""Hamas"" stands in front of a big dilemma, as any dialogue with the United States It will be required to make fundamental concessions that contradict its basic principles, and at the same time, the continuation of the isolation of the international movement may increase its internal and external pressures, which puts it in an existential dilemma that is difficult to get out of it without radical changes in its policy and strategy.

A deep political position stems from the realization of ""Hamas"", the size of the crisis

The writer and political analyst d. Ahmed Rafik Awad said that the statements of Musa Abu Marzouq, which indicated the movement's desire to open new communication channels with the current American administration, is not just a diplomatic courtesy, but rather reflects a deep political position stemming from the realization of ""Hamas"" of the size of the crisis it faces.

Awad notes that after the disastrous destruction of the Gaza Strip, and the strict military and political blockade, Hamas feels that it is in an existential predicament, this impasse is not limited to the military or material side only, but also extends to the political side, where Hamas feels that There are international and regional efforts aimed at ""deleting"" the political equation.

Awad notes that ""Hamas"" may be prepared to adopt new policies, which may include a shift to a fully political movement, or even to abandon the administration of the Gaza Strip as part of a political settlement More, these steps may aim to open closed doors with the American administration, and to search for new partners in the region, including the Palestinian Authority, in order to achieve Palestinian reconciliation that allows a deeper dialogue with the international community.

Dr. Instead of fundamental questions about the future of ""Hamas"": Can the movement turn into a purely political entity? Can you recognize Israel as part of a political settlement? Will it accept an Arab or international administration for the Gaza Strip? These questions reflect the great challenges facing ""Hamas"", especially in light of the tremendous pressures they are exposed to.

Awad believes that ""Hamas"" may deal with multiple scenarios that preserve its political and military existence, but it excludes that the movement will offer any reward for Israel, such as recognition of it, after the destruction of Gaza, however, Hamas may be ready to deal with Arab proposals American aims to achieve a long -term calm, or even participate in security and political arrangements that guarantee relatively stability in Gaza.

Awad notes that one of the great challenges facing ""Hamas"" is how to build confidence with the international and regional community. Even if the movement provides guarantees regarding its political intentions, it is difficult Its belief in its complex military and political history, and the delivery of weapons, which is one of the main international demands, may make ""Hamas"" very weak and unable to impose its conditions in any future negotiations.

Awad believes that the Hamas movement may resort to dramatic options, including entering into a secret or public dialogue with the American administration, in order to preserve its political and military presence in the Gaza Strip, and this dialogue may include painful settlements, but it may be necessary to ensure the survival Movement under the current circumstances.

Awad notes that this trend may also be driven by the current American policy, especially with President Donald Trump's return to the political interface, so Trump, known for his fast dealings and firmness, may represent an opportunity for Hamas to achieve quick political and security arrangements in the Gaza Strip.

But Awad warns that any solo dialogue between ""Hamas"" and the United States may negatively affect the unified strategic vision of the Palestinians, and weakens the idea of ??an independent Palestinian state, and this dialogue may create new divisions within the Palestinian political scene, which complicates national reconciliation efforts.

Awad believes that ""Hamas"" stands at a crossroads, where you must It must balance between preserving its principles and winning new international legitimacy, and this exact balance may be the key to the movement of the movement in light of the changing political conditions in the region and the world.

A qualitative development in political dynamics

Professor d. Jamal Harfoush, professor of curricula of scientific research and political studies at the University of the Academic Center for Research in Brazil, that the statements of Musa Abu Marzouk, deputy head of the political bureau of the ""Hamas"" movement abroad, on the movement's willingness to open a dialogue with the United States and provide protection for US President Donald Trump's envoy It is a qualitative development in Palestinian and international political dynamics.

Harfoush explains that this step may open new horizons for various diplomatic paths, which may involve the reformulation of the relationship between the United States and the Palestinian political movements.

Harfoush confirms that this initiative is considered an attempt by ""Hamas"" to expand the circle of international actors involved in the Palestinian issue, which may contribute to breaking the current stalemate.

Harfoush confirms that this development is an indication of a new flexibility adopted by ""Hamas"", especially in light of the urgent need to improve conditions Humanitarian and economic in the Gaza Strip, and this step may reflect Hamas's desire to highlight itself as an active and responsible party capable of communicating with influential international parties.

In practice, Harfoush notes that the success of these paths depends on the United States ’response to this offer, and its willingness to reconsider its traditional policies towards the Hamas movement, as this step may constitute a gateway to rearrange the papers on the Palestinian scene if it is exploited wisely And knowing.

Harfoush explains that ""Hamas"" as a resistance movement has its own political and military approach, and since its inception it has adopted a different position for the Palestine Liberation Organization regarding the recognition of Israel, while the PLO ended up with the Oslo agreements in which it recognized Israel as part of the settlement path, and the position of Hamas remains the position of ""Hamas"" and remains the position of Hamas. It focuses on the historical rights of the Palestinian people, and refused to make any concession related to the principle of national sovereignty or the waiver of lands.

However, Harfoush notes that ""Hamas"" today works within a different political reality, which requires her to consider a strategy to achieve concrete gains for the Palestinian people while preserving national constants, so it can be said that Hamas, if it is involved in any dialogue path, may start from the basis of reassessing field conditions and needs without this means adopting identical positions with the PLO, but rather building different strategies commensurate with their vision and principles.

Harfoush confirms that the known American conditions for dialogue, which include recognition of Israel, rejecting violence, and commitment to previous agreements, has always been an obstacle to any communication between ""Hamas"" and the American administration, however, politics is the art of possible, and depends on flexibility and adaptation to variables.

Harfoush confirms that ""Hamas"", as it seems from the statements of its leaders, does not deal with these conditions in an absolute acceptance or rejection form, but rather starts from a pragmatic approach that seeks to achieve the interests of its people within the available political framework, and that the movement's willingness to provide protection for an American envoy and his visit to Gaza may be An implicit message that there is preparation for dialogue without giving up the fundamental principles.

Harfoush believes that ""Hamas"" is unlikely to make initial concessions that contradict its national vision, but it may seek to find a formula of understanding that achieves a balance between the requirements of political reality and the rights of the non -negative Palestinian people To behave, but the question remains open about the extent of the parties' ability to create a dialogue environment that enables to overcome pre -conditions and reach compromises that serve everyone.

Providing a realistic policy model in the post -war stage

The writer and political analyst Suleiman Bisharat believes that the willingness of Hamas to open a dialogue with the United States reflects the movement's desire to present a realistic model for the post -war policy on the Gaza Strip.

Bisharat explains that ""Hamas"" seeks not to anticipate the international community, but rather wants to appear as an open power to political solutions that can restore some rights to the Palestinian issue.

Bisharat confirms that this step indicates political realism in international relations, especially in light of the new international composition with the arrival of US President Donald Trump, who holds political visions and projects he wants to impose, whether the Palestinians accepted or not.

Bisharat stresses that the political intelligence of the Palestinians lies in how to deal with this stage without exception any component of the Palestinian components.

Bisharat notes that the future paths of the Palestinian issue require severe caution and awareness, in addition to a Palestinian unit and an inclusive discourse that expresses rights Fully Palestinian.

Bisharat confirms that any future dialogue with any international party must start from an integrated Palestinian ground and a comprehensive Palestinian understanding, which requires an internal Palestinian dialogue before opening any future doors with the international parties.

Bisharat warns that Israeli measures in the West Bank and Gaza Strip indicate the existence of a future Israeli vision, which may intersect with the American vision, which leads to the necessity of a unified Palestinian to reduce the damage that may be caused to the Palestinian cause.

Bisharat confirms that there is an urgent need for a comprehensive political umbrella for the whole Palestinian that is a basic title at this stage.

Bisharat notes that major conflicts are witnessing articulated stations, as happened in the American war on Afghanistan and the Syrian situation, where political doors were opened to forces that were classified as terrorist, stressing that this does not mean that ""Hamas"" could be a substitute for the Palestine Liberation Organization, but rather it is necessary That there is a comprehensive political umbrella for the whole Palestinian.

Bisharat explains that the United States may try to adapt ""Hamas"" in the political paths, but it will not deal with it from the principle of goodwill, but will impose a political path that may be forced by Hamas, Hamas. I accept it, pointing out that ""Hamas"" is a balance between its principles and political realism, which puts it in a very sensitive stage.

It indicates that the current stage is a stage of labor, and it is not possible to assert the path that the Palestinian issue will take, especially with the rapid changes at the internal, regional and international levels.

Bisharat believes that the future American vision of the Middle East and the Palestinian cause are still unclear, which makes it early to judge the directions of this stage.

Bisharat explains that ""Hamas"" is facing great pressure in the balance of its principles with political realism, especially in light of its fear of losing the support of its fans.

Bisharat believes that this stage requires an internal Palestinian dialogue to create compatible pillars that can be launched in the next stage.

Bisharat confirms that it is too early to talk about opening a comprehensive dialogue between ""Hamas"" and the United States, but he confirms that any future dialogue must be launched from an integrated Palestinian ground and a unified political discourse that fully expresses Palestinian rights.

Direct dialogue opportunities are still small in the short term

The professor of political science at Al -Quds Open University, Qusai Hamed, believes that Musa's statements Abu Marzouq, Vice -President of the Political Bureau of Hamas abroad, for the American New York Times, about the movement's willingness to open a comprehensive dialogue with the United States and facilitate a visit to Whimkov, reflects Hamas's desire to overcome obstacles to opening channels directly with the Trump administration, and its willingness to agree On new arrangements regarding the Gaza Strip, including the acceptance of the Gaza administration or rule by an agreed upon one, without there being a direct participation from Movement. But in the broader framework, Hamed believes that ""Hamas"" sends messages to the United States and the international community that the movement is open to dialogue and political approach, and that the policy of exclusion and siege in addition to the military strikes launched by Israel during its war on the Gaza Strip, and targeting its political and military leaders, all of which failed in Eliminating the movement, and that ""Hamas"" was able to rearrange its ranks and appear in the appearance of the victor.

Hamed notes that the opportunities for direct dialogue between ""Hamas"" and the United States are still small in the short term, despite the presence of some dialogues related to the completion of the exchange deal and the ""next day"" arrangements in the Gaza Strip, which takes place through intermediaries.

Hamed notes that the administration The American is aware of the difficulty of excluding ""Hamas"" from any future arrangements in Gaza, despite its attempts to reduce the movement's role in these arrangements.

With regard to the visit of Trump's envoy to Gaza, Hamed believes that the security complications associated with this visit may reduce the chances of completing it in the near future, especially that facilitating it requires coordination with ""Hamas"", whether directly or indirectly, to provide security protection, and that any visit from This type will be a discussion between the American administration and ""Hamas"" through intermediaries.

As for the involvement of ""Hamas"" with a political path with Israel, Hamid believes that ""Hamas"" does not mind this, provided that it is a feasible path and leads to the Palestinians achieving their hopes and aspirations in a state on the borders of June 4, 1967.

Hamed believes that ""Hamas"" has gone an advanced way to determine its position on this and culminates in 2017 by issuing the public policy document in which it showed an openness to establishing a Palestinian state on the borders of 1967, but the two issues of recognition of Israel or abandoning weapons remain not subject to concession.

Hamed believes that linking the United States accepting the dialogue with Hamas with traditional conditions (recognition of Israel and abandoning work Military) illogical.

However, Hamed believes that the communication lines between ""Hamas"" and the United States may be indirectly condensed, especially in light of the new arrangements that the American administration plans regarding the Gaza Strip.

Hamed believes that Abu Marzouq's statements, which came in an interview with an American newspaper, represents a diplomatic message addressed to decision makers in the United States, confirming that ""Hamas"" is still a political and military force influencing the Palestinian scene, and that its exception to any future arrangements will be difficult , Especially in light of Israel's failure to achieve its military targets in Gaza more than 440 days of confrontations.",PS
"Israeli researcher Naomi Newman stressed that the reality
Palestinian
It does not match the plan of US President Donald
Trump
Regarding the displacement of the people of the sector
Gaza
And stressing that ""the deep association of the Palestinians to their land is still an essential component of the Palestinian national identity.""
Neuman, a visiting colleague at the Washington Institute, explained that the Trump vision, which was based on purely economic considerations, was met with a wide opposition from the international community and the Arab countries, with the exception of Israel, where the American president seeks to ""transfer two million Palestinians to other countries such as Egypt and Jordan, Even to distant destinations such as Morocco and Somalia. ""
She added in a report published by
Washington Institute
And that ""Trump depicts Gaza, such as the Middle East, where the Palestinians will be resettled in safer and beautiful places.""

She explained that the Trump administration tried to submit the displacement as ""temporary or phased"", as the US President said, ""I hope we can do something good that does not make them want to return again.""
The Israeli researcher also indicated that the American administration planned to supervise the ""rehabilitation"" project, while other countries are sponsored With its funding.
The researcher confirmed that the Palestinians, with their various political orientations, strongly rejected the plan, as the Palestinian Authority considered it a ""dangerous violation of international law"", and its president Mahmoud Abbas rushed to ""coordination with Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to develop a common position.""
In the same context, Hamas stressed that it ""will not allow the ethnic cleansing and displace the Palestinians from Gaza"", and the researcher indicated a statement by the member of the movement's political bureau, Izzat Al -Rashr, in which he said that ""the plan reflects a deep ignorance of Palestine and the region, Gaza is not a real estate sold and bought, An integral part of our occupied Palestinian land. ""
Neuman pointed out that the Palestinians in Gaza received the announcement of the plan with feelings of anger and rejection, as one of the gaze young women told the media: ""We are not an abandoned building that one can claim to be owned. We are a people, we belong to this land.""
Others also sarcastically about the reason for Trump's failure to offer the United States as a Palestinian immigration destination, while many Palestinian commentators considered that the plan represents a new attempt by a ""second catastrophe"".
The researcher pointed out that Palestinian social media A wave of anger witnessed what users considered a ""US -Israeli conspiracy to erase their national identity.""
The researcher explained that the Trump plan was not the first of its kind. Since the occupation of 1967, Israel has sought to encourage the emigration of Palestinians from Gaza by various means, but it only succeeded in this on a limited scale. She added that ""Israel has tried for decades to push the residents of Gaza to leave, by restricting job opportunities and reducing the possibilities of decent living.""
She pointed out that these policies did not succeed in achieving the desired goal, as only a limited number of Palestinians left, despite the opening of the borders in some periods.
Regarding the Arab position, Newman confirmed that the Arab countries rejected the plan because they ""lacked two essential elements: ensuring that part of the Palestinians in Gaza remain to prove the possibility of rehabilitation without the displacement of the population, and the inclusion of the operation within a political path that leads to the establishment of a Palestinian state.""
Show related news
She added that these countries are now trying to ""show their willingness to contribute by providing financial and logistical assistance, and even the formation of a joint Arab security force in Gaza"", in an effort to carry the Trump administration to ""give up its plan.""
The researcher pointed out that ""Qatar Turkey is making efforts to integrate Hamas into the institutions of the Palestine Liberation Organization, ""but it excluded the success of these attempts due to"" the absence of a direct dialogue between Fatah and Hamas "", suggesting that the agreement will be limited to"" a general framework such as the establishment of a civil committee under the umbrella of the PLO. ""
The researcher concluded by saying that ""Trump's vision of the emigration of the Palestinians from Gaza and its conversion to a economic receiver was based on a purely economic logic,"" but she ignored the fact that ""the Palestinian steadfastness remains a fundamental element of the components of the Palestinian national identity,"" noting that ""the absence of an Israeli plan is clear for the next day in Gaza contributed to creating a political vacuum exploited by various parties. ""
She added that ""Israel, if it succeeds in drafting a clear plan, will be able to form the political situation in the region, with the door open to strengthen its relations with the Arab countries.""",QA

"Although US President Donald Trump is clearly seeking to serve Israel by escalating threats against the Palestinians, these policies may lead to unexpected results, ultimately in the interest of the Palestinian issue instead of weakening it. Instead of pushing the Palestinian threats to surrender or immigration, it leads to generating new ideas for resistance, enhancing internal unity, and revealing the true face of Israel before the world, which restores the Palestinian issue to the center of international interest.
The more threats targeting the Palestinian presence, the more Palestinians create new methods to confront the occupation. At each articulated stage, the Palestinians face challenges with unconventional methods, whether at the level of popular, military, or even legal and diplomatic resistance. For example, the long blockade of the Gaza Strip did not lead to the surrender of the population, but rather turned the Strip into a center for innovation in the means of defense and attack, despite all the restrictions imposed on it. The return marches that started in 2018 were another model to re -impose the issue of the right of return on the international agenda, after the Trump administration tried to undermine it by stopping support UNRWA and the transfer of the American embassy to Jerusalem.
The direct threat to the deportation of the Palestinians or the annexation of large parts of the West Bank, re -prioritization within the Palestinian ranks, where political differences retreat to the existential danger that threatens everyone. In previous crises, such as the first and second uprisings, repressive Israeli policies led to strengthening the unity between the Palestinians, and made the resistance of the occupation the maximum priority. Today, with the escalation of threats, calls for unifying the Palestinian ranks are increasing, whether between the factions or between the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza and the lands of the occupied interior, because everyone realizes that the conflict is no longer only political, but has become a survival struggle.
At the international level, the Trump administration appears to provide an unintended service to the Palestinians, by revealing the true face of Israel in front of the world. For many years, Israel tried to present itself as a country looking for peace, but when the United States adopts a public speech that talks about the displacement of the Palestinians by force or the inclusion of their lands, Israel is losing the moral cover that was hiding behind it. These policies strengthen Palestinian positions in international institutions, and are pushing organizations such as nations United and the International Criminal Court to review the escalation of pressure on Israel, as happened when the Trump administration moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, which led to a wide international consensus against the decision and Washington isolated politically.
Parallel to this, Trump's policies contribute to returning the Palestinian issue to the global interface, after continuous attempts to marginalize it. In recent years, it seemed as if some Arab and Western countries were heading to normalize their relations with Israel, ignoring the Palestinian cause. But with the escalation of threats to displacement and annexation, governments and peoples have become an undeniable fact, which is that the Israeli danger not only threatens the Palestinians, but may lead to destabilizing the entire region. This reality pushes many parties to reconsider their positions, and reaffirm the centrality of the Palestinian issue.
In conclusion, it seems that Trump, who thinks he is practicing the utmost pressure on the Palestinians, ends inadvertently pushing them towards more cohesion and renewal in confrontation methods. If Trump's intention is to eliminate the Palestinian issue, his policies may completely achieve the opposite, as the Palestinians become more determined to Survival, and more able to impose their issue on the international scene, is supported by increasing internal unit and a global, renewed awareness of their rights.
Trump and return the initiative to the Palestinian people
Despite the attempts of US President Donald Trump to undermine the Palestinian being and weaken it politically and geographically, these pressures may lead to the opposite of what he seeks, as the initiative returns to the Palestinian people themselves, who has always proven their ability to adapt to the various stages and respond to challenges in innovative ways. Every time the major powers tried to impose solutions that detract from Palestinian rights, the response came from the Palestinian street itself, which managed to turn the equation and reformulate the political scene according to its priorities.
Throughout history, the Palestinian political leadership was not the main driver of the major stages of transformation. Rather, it was the popular action that identified the path and forced everyone to restore accounts. In the 1987 uprising, there was no central decision to ignite the confrontation, but it started from the street, and imposed itself on the Palestinian leaders and the whole world, which later led to a strategic change in the form of the conflict. In the second intifada in 2000, the popular response came to re -draw rules The game after it became clear that the political path did not achieve Palestinian aspirations. Today, as American -backed Israeli threats escalate, Palestinians find themselves in front of a similar moment, as the mass action becomes the main driver of the next stage.
Israel's attempts, with American support, to dismantle the Palestinian identity or undermine its components, may push the Palestinian people to develop new forms of resistance and adapt to the new reality. Just as the Palestinians succeeded in confronting the displacement in 1948 by adhering to the right to return despite the passage of decades, and they were also able to transform the siege imposed on Gaza into a motive to develop their capabilities, they are able to transform the current threats into an opportunity to enhance their political and field presence. The next stage may be the stage of ""re -invention of resistance"", where the mass action is integrated with technological creativity, legal and diplomatic pressure, which creates a new dynamic that is difficult for the occupation to confront.
As the challenges continue, the features of a new Palestinian stage are clear that exceeds the imposed political restrictions. The Palestinians have become more aware of the necessity of building their own tools away from regional and international accounts, than might It leads to the emergence of a new Palestinian situation capable of restoring the initiative. This continuous adaptation to the requirements of different stages is what made the Palestinian issue remain despite all attempts to end it, which will make her impose herself again on the scene, no matter how severe pressure and challenges are.
Netanyahu's policies and the return of the one -state option to the forefront
The trend in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is to deepen the occupation and reject the two -state solution, may ultimately lead to completely counterproductive results of what he seeks. Instead of paving the way to perpetuate the Israeli hegemony and impose a new reality on the Palestinians, it restores to the forefront ideas that were in slumber, such as the cucumber of a single democratic state, which may become in the future the most logical alternative in light of the collapse of the two -state solution.
The two-state solution has always been the option that international efforts to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict have been based. However, Netanyahu's policies, which are sometimes supported by the Trump administration, led to a systematic undermining this solution by expanding settlement, attempts to include parts of the West Bank, and dealing with the Palestinians as a people that can be overcome Or even displacement. With the erosion of the chances of the establishment of an independent Palestinian state due to settlement and the dismantling of Palestinian institutions, a completely different equation is highlighted, which is that Israel itself is pushing towards an option that it did not even want to discuss: the one state between the Palestinians and the Israelis.
Although Israel has always rejected this option for fear of losing its Jewish character, Netanyahu's policies make the two -state solution impossible, and thus imposes on future generations to face an existential question: if there are no two states, what is the alternative? Palestinians who find themselves trapped between occupation and settlement will start, urgent or later, in adopting a different discourse, calling for full equality within one country that extends from the sea to the river, which may become more attractive to international parties that support human rights and democracy.
Instead of leading Netanyahu a project that ends the Palestinian issue, in reality it will underestimate it from converting it from the issue of a national liberation to the issue of civil and political rights within one entity, which may be more dangerous to the Zionist project itself. If Israel continues to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, the Palestinians will find themselves in front of an option Demanding the rights of full citizenship, which threatens the demographic structure of Israel and undermines its foundations as a Jewish state.
Ultimately, the more Israel continues to close the horizon of the two -state solution, the more likely the conflict will turn into a battle for rights and equality in one country, which may impose a new reality on everyone.",PS
