He concluded by stressing a role
Peoples ""continue to sympathize with the people of Gaza, with demonstrations in their countries, and organize

""You will not do justice to them and these reasons""
In his vision, the expert said
In administration Strategy and Crisis Management, Dr. Murad Ali: ""I personally not
Optimistic about the summit, for several reasons, the first of which is: what history says, ""explaining that
“The previous events did not witness from the Arab countries or governments to take any steps

To ""Arabi 21"", he added: ""And even today they are unable to enter the tents

Second, he pointed out that
""What has been leaked so far about what the Egyptian plan is that there will be a plan
Reconstruction under the supervision of a Palestinian committee and put several lines under the word of a committee, because this is what he said
Yesterday, Netanyahu, in his statement, had pledged that Hamas would be excluded from Gaza, and there will be no
The existence of the Palestinian Authority, and therefore it seems that the Egyptian plan is also compatible, with goals and promises
Trump for his voters. ""
And thirdly, Ali emphasized that he
He rejects this plan because ""its primary goal is to exclude the resistance and hand over its weapons, Tear
Gaza's teeth so as not to cause any headache for the occupier, and it will become another model of the West Bank that
The settlers praise it and the occupation praises it, storming it at any time, and prevents the transfer of funds
Aid to the families of the prisoners and detainees.
And he is ""in the end
The West Bank is governed by Palestinian names; This wants to repeat this in Gaza, and unfortunately what has been leaked
About the Egyptian plan is similar to this, ""asking:"" If there are guarantees that have been said about that
The plan, will these guarantees be achieved?, And if it is in the agreed ceasefire
From several weeks, he was between him to enter specific assistance and enter caravans and not applied,
What makes us make sure that they will adhere to the Egyptian plan? ""
And he concluded to say: ""What
It makes us pessimistic is the successive statements of the Secretary -General of the Arab League, Ahmed Abu Al -Gheit
His assistant Hossam Zaki, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdel -Ati, and the statements of those close to
The Emirati authorities, and the hesitating king of Jordan, who did not face Trump strongly in
Their press conference in Washington last week. ""
The Egyptian expert believes
That ""all these statements that talk about the lack of enthusiasm and demand them to move away and demand
The factions by step all indicate that There is an Arab compatibility with the Trump administration and management
Netanyahu to implement a specific plan, which makes us pessimistic and do not expect the best. ""
He concluded his speech by saying:
“Arab summits were held for Gaza, so what were the outputs of those summits? Did you offer anything?
I remember a summit in November 2023, a second summit a year later, then nothing,

"The displacement of the Palestinians from their lands is an Israeli dream that the Hebrew state has not stopped thinking about it since the Nakba of 1948, and from time to time the idea is renewed, whether from within, or from the Allied America, where the latest attempts was the suggestion of President Donald Trump to transfer residents in Gaza to Egypt and Jordan, the two Arab countries They are adjacent to the borders of the occupied Palestinian territories.

According to the monitoring of the ""Middle East"", the calls varied between statements and official plans, especially an American -Israel 2023.

Trump's proposal, which was presented, on Saturday, was popular and media rejection in Egypt, was considered by the Palestinian historian, Abdelkader Yassin, ""not the first and the last will not be in the plans of displacement of the Palestinians"", expecting that ""the informal rejection of these projects, whether from the Palestinian resistance movements, will increase , Or from the Arab peoples. ”

Yassin told Al -Sharq Al -Awsat that the projects of resettlement of the Palestinians in the Arab countries have known a frequent historical presence, especially starting in 1953, with what was known at the time as the “Sinai Plan”, as well as the “Al -Jazeera Project”. Northern Syria, to settle the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq, and the ""Johnson Project"" to resettle the Palestinians in the eastern and western countryside around the Jordan River.

And he confirms that ""Washington and its ally Israel are usually standing historically behind those projects that have received an official Arab rejection, and at the popular level as well, especially the Palestinian.""

The Palestinians knew ""forced displacement"" of their homeland in 1948, with the announcement of the establishment of the State of Israel, and the following year the United Nations established the Palestinian Refugee Relief Agency (UNRWA) in order to respond to the needs of nearly three quarters of a million Palestinians.

The year 1953 witnessed the launch of the ""Sinai Plan"", which was supported by Washington, and includes ""displacement of Palestinians"" for this Egyptian spot, according to the historian Abdel Qader Yassin, and July (July) came 1967 to continue the production machine for attempts to displacement, through the launch of the Israeli politician and military, Egal Alon, The Council of Ministers of his country must have a plan to impose a regional settlement aimed at deporting Palestinians to Jordan and Egypt, and did not see the light.

In 1970, the commander of the southern region of the Israeli army, Ariel Sharon, who later became prime minister, adopted a discharged plan The Gaza Strip is one of its residents, and hundreds of them were transferred to Sinai and the city of Al -Arish, which were under the Israeli occupation at the time, and did not succeed in continuing.

The plans continued with the year 2000, with the Israeli military commander, Guyra Island, continued a project that includes Cairo's concessions in Sinai in favor of a proposed Palestinian state, in exchange for privileges to Egypt, and he was not successful ... and that project was repeated after 4 years by the former president The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Joshua Bin Arrei, did not come out of the discussion of the implementation as well.

In the first state of Trump (2017 - 2020), the media started in 2018, about an American plan to displace the Palestinians under what was called the ""Deal of the Century"", and in March 2019, the King of Jordan, Abdullah II, announced the rejection of the idea of ??""the alternative homeland And Emiratisation, stressing that Palestine and Jerusalem are a red line, amid repeated Egyptian official and media positions on the rejection of the displacement plans.

Trump officially revealed the deal in his first term in 2020, under the title ""Peace on the Road of Prosperity"", and met an explicit Arab rejection, and was not achieved with the loss of the US President at the time the presidential elections in front of his rival Joe Biden.

The ""Gaza War"" was a station New to an Israeli return to the ""displacement plan"", where a paper published by the Israeli ""Mjafaf"" institute revealed, on October 17, 2023, calling for removing the Palestinians to Egypt, and on the 14th of the following month, the extremist finance minister, Battalil Smotrich, called for ""voluntary migration and the assimilation of Arabs Gaza in the countries of the world. ”

At the beginning of 2024, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair denied a report of the Israeli channel ""12"" on talks it said was then in Israel on ""displacement of the Palestinians"" from the Gaza Strip to Arab countries. In late November, Smotrich renewed the call to encourage Gaza residents to emigrate within two years.

On Saturday, Trump launched an initiative for both Egypt and Jordan to receive more Palestinian refugees from Gaza, amid a broad Palestinian rejection, especially from Hamas, while it received wide support from the Israeli right, headed by the resigned Israeli National Security Minister Etamar bin Ghafir, And finance, with a smokeric.

"US President Donald Trump's insistence on displacing part of the Palestinian people from the Gaza Strip, to reflect psychological behavior in ""I am wild"" in the man. The issue of ""I am brutal"" at Trump is referred to by the Danish behavioral psychologist Henrik Tinglef. It is not necessarily based on the competence of knowledge of a man and his supporters, as much as she tries to feed the swelling of I (Igo) individual and collective. Tinglif explained Trump's psychological in his attempt to extract Greenland from Denmark and Panama and the annexation of Canada, as it represents the ignorant and expansionist arrogance that owns the man, whose crew carefully chose to maintain his position as a remembrance of alpha in the herd.

Trump's proposal is the displacement of the Palestinians of Gaza, and based on what analyzes Tingleb, it indicates ignorance and arrogance, as it seems as if he ignores that all his country's ammunition, and the madness of the great power of the power of Zionism in the request and translation of genocide, did not lead them to another catastrophe. Trump's ""compassion"" on the people of Gaza, amid the ragness of arrogance and arrogance, did not advance him to curb the thirst for blood in Tel Aviv, nor to stop the removal of the Palestinian humanity and the shame from the public request to seek genocide and ethnic cleansing. Trump lifted settler terrorists from the sanctions list means that it is not Less submitted, no matter how arrogant, than the Zionist Joe Biden for the likes of Polish immigrants Benjamin Netanyahu and Ukrainian Btlael Smotrich, the Israeli extremist finance minister.

The arrogance of the ego monsters of Trump is not faced by submission, nor by accepting that he addresses states and peoples as if they are not sovereign, but rather the shock of rejection and alliance with European and American voices. The imposition of displacement is a war of war and ethnic cleansing. Before this and that, man and whisper consultants in his ear need to tell him about the meaning of the flood of the return of the Gazans to the northern Gaza Strip despite its destruction. Rather, his notification is that the displacement only means expanding the resistance act towards another geographical area. Perhaps Trump's embassies tell him about the realities of the ideas and proposals of the Arab streets and international solidarity with them in response, to reduce the crime committed against Palestine for 76 years. Trump can withdraw and resettle a million and a half million Israeli immigrants, in cooperation with Germany and France, especially from the double nationalities.

Yes, perhaps the adults on Gaza, who are ignorant of the perpetrators of the crime, consider that the proposal to transfer the Jews from Palestine is ""anti -Semitic"", and that is a real endorsement of the meaning of arrogance and acceptance of passing war and genocide crimes As long as blood is Palestinian and Arab. On the other hand, the responsibility of the Arab world is not in glorifying and steadfastness, but rather in the behavior on the basis that adhering to the land has a maintenance of the national security of the neighboring and long neighboring countries. The capable Arab countries have an opportunity to enhance the steadfastness of Gaza and the smile of their wounds, even by opening the doors for the employment and Gazan employees, similar to the Egyptian, the Syrian, the Lebanese, the Algerian, the Tunisian, the Sudanese and others. The reception of the workforce from Gaza will not make adherence to Palestine less for those who support his family and establish a life on the ruins of tremendous destruction. Starting on Earth is not done through verbal solidarity boxes.

Instead of confronting the projects of displacement with statements, and attempts to Judaize occupied Jerusalem are met, the Arab world can curb them with quick projects to rebuild the Gaza Strip and break the unjust siege. As for the behavior of the psychological behavioral obsession with Trump and its management in a fluent and gray language, this will not even protect the selfish national interests of the targeted countries. Ultimately, Trump is not an inevitable destiny that must be subjected to. Even in the language of interests, whoever loses the arrogance of the arrogant man is America and its interests, and she is the researcher of allies in Confronting the challenges of greatness related to its global location and future.",UK

It is noteworthy that Egypt has officially rejected Trump's proposal to bear the responsibility of the Gaza Strip administration instead of the Israeli occupation and the displacement of the people of the besieged sector, and the creation of what he called ""Riviera Middle East"" after the transfer of the Palestinians to other countries, including Egypt and Jordan, a proposal that Jordan also rejected .

"The national and Islamic forces in the Gaza Strip warned that the Palestinian people are facing an existential threat with the escalation of displacement plans, stressing that these projects will not be limited to the Gaza Strip, but will extend to the West Bank in an attempt to liquidate the Palestinian issue.
This came during the urgent and emergency national meeting organized by the Follow -up Committee for the National and Islamic Forces this morning in the Unknown Soldier Square in Gaza City to confront the plans of US President Trump to liquidate the Palestinian issue.
During the conference, which was followed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the national forces called for an urgent meeting for the general secretaries of the Palestinian factions, with the aim of coordinating positions and taking steps to confront the current challenges, stressing that the Palestinian rank unity is a need to confront these risks.
The national and Islamic forces condemned the statements of US President Donald Trump regarding the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, describing it as a declaration of war aimed at uprooting the Palestinians from their land. She emphasized that the Palestinian people, who made sacrifices for decades, will not leave their homeland and will remain rooted in it, and will face any attempts to displace all available means.
She also stressed that what failed The occupation in achieving it through killing and genocide will not succeed in imposing it through political pressure or economic temptations, stressing that the displacement plans are ethnic cleansing and will be faced with wide resistance.
The national and Islamic forces in Gaza called on the next Arab summit to take practical and decisive steps to confront criminal displacement plans, calling on the Arab and Islamic countries to assume their responsibilities and support the Palestinian steadfastness politically and economically.
In light of these developments, the national and Islamic forces stressed the importance of escalating the confrontation in the West Bank, stressing that the current stage requires an escalation of resisting action against the Israeli occupation, to deter displacement and settlement plans.
The national and Islamic forces concluded their statement by emphasizing that the Palestinian people will remain steadfast in the face of all attempts to liquidate and uproot, and that any attempt to impose a new reality will be faced with a unified resistance from the Palestinian people in all places of their existence.
In turn, Abu Bilal Al -Aklouk said, in his speech during the national meeting, representing the mayors and clans of Gaza: ""Trump's scheme aimed at displacing the Palestinian people from the Gaza Strip under false arguments that will not succeed, and will fail in front of steadfastness The Palestinians added, ""We say today to Trump, the American administration and the occupation: Gaza and its land is more expensive than all the temptations of the world. We will not abandon the Gaza Strip, nor will we leave our land and our homeland, nor will we accept an alternative homeland. ”Abu Bilal Al -Aklouk renewed his assertion that the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip will remain constant on their land despite all the challenges they face. Our people will address Trump's plans, Suhair Khadr said In a speech during the meeting, a representative of Palestinian women: ""Our people will face these plans aimed at liquidating The Palestinian issue, through the Trump plan to displace the Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank.

"In addition, the consequences of the ""Al -Aqsa Flood"" operation on October 7 were hidden and disastrous and only led to killing children and women, intimidating and displacing the safe, this operation was like an earthquake that has its highly dangerous spoofing secretions on the Palestinians and Arabs in general from the Gulf to the ocean, and what is the invitation The displacement that US President Donald Trump stated in a moment in which the investment sense of real estate overwhelmed the sense The diplomat and the human dimension in which the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu agreed with him in the deal of its law, “I agree with you, so he agreed with me in that,” except one of these bad spoofing secretions on the Palestinians and the Arab peoples that may excel in their horror, size and effects of the first catastrophe, and therefore the call for displacement The Palestinians are condemned by the Arabs, as is the war that was launched on Gaza after the foolish flood adventure, which left only backward The destruction and misery, and the world has only shown the policy of the measures and the fait accompli that the politicians of the Western world deal with the Palestinian affairs.
The reality of the Arab -Palestinian conflict confirms that every Palestinian detail has the ability to mobilize to stand by the side Palestinian brothers to establish their free independent state, but does the policy adopted from the current American administration justify the entire Arab states and dignity in the face of the United States of America? Isn't it sufficient for what the Palestinians and Arabs have suffered from the loss of lands and losses in lives and money? In my estimation, whoever pays the strengthening of such a trend are those who were involved in igniting the unequal war between the Palestinians and Israel, and I mean explicitly the phrase this ruling is the axis And he told her when Iraq was presented to him on a plate of gold after the adventure of the late Saddam Hussein's foolishness in invading Kuwait and igniting an unequal confrontation Against the United States of America.
We do not shed the process of displacing the Palestinians and the political approach behind it, as they are condemned by the Arab peoples and from the legitimate Arab countries, especially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and from some countries that have prevailed in principle humanitarian positions and international legitimacy over the blind subordination of America the head of the Western camp, but, however we have to We mention that the waving of this The process is not new to the Palestinians, as it is an Israeli -international practical step that always followed any war between the Palestinians and the Israelis and its cost is high on the work of rebuilding what was destroyed and returned the displaced to their homes, and it is also a policy that Israel pursues against the Palestinians with the lands of the land despite the calls of Arabs and international agencies to reject Such a stressful policy of human feelings and the antagonism of every Arab -Israeli negotiation, and for this let us consider the displacement as an Israeli policy and as a result of whims The wars that were implicated by the axis of the ""resistance"" Arab countries.
The call for displacement, unfortunately, pledged this time to support and support President Donald Trump, hitting the wall with all international covenants and laws, and with all treaties that created a bit of peace between Israel, Egypt, the Palestinians and Jordanians through the Camp David and Wadi Araba agreement, and there is no surprise in this matter; This is because President Trump's denying and constant readiness to throw agreements and treaties in the garbage basket.
Here he is ready, and even in an effort to sell NATO, which his country leads only because he did not meet with European governments. The members of the alliance to increase the percentage of participation in European defense budgets, and here he sells Ukraine also if it does not intend and put its precious resources under American behavior, these only two example Dalan are on President Trump's positions on the agreements, and his willingness to ensure America's interest to sacrifice everything, and we should not forget All positions are changing by Trump if he sees a service for American interests.
Israel's threat to displacement will remain continuous, and America will not stop standing by its side in everything that it deems to achieve the interest of Israel, without paying attention to the consequences of that for the Palestinians. As soon as Trump announced his intention to displace the Palestinians to establish investment projects in Gaza, the Arab diplomatic reaction that rejects the displacement process was ready, especially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which I gathered to respond to by searching for an alternative to the displacement process, so Israel seized the opportunity of Trump's declaration and decided to establish a ""voluntary immigration agency"" to facilitate the process Immigration for those wishing to be citizens of Gaza. In my opinion, those wishing to migrate have been many under the rule of ""Hamas"" to Gaza, and this is what the coming days will prove. Accordingly, the treatment of forced displacement and voluntary migration The proposed dependent on the Palestinian side believing in the peace process that leads to the establishment of the Palestinian state alongside Israel and is able to bear the responsibility for preserving security and stability, and not ""Hamas"" is certainly the authority concerned with this; Because her agenda is linked in its depth to an ideology that sees the homelands ""a handful of dust"", and with foreign parties, the Palestinian issue has nothing but a bright slogan that shines its image among the naive Arabs.
There is no solution to the Palestinian issue except by adopting the principle of peaceful coexistence between the Palestinians and Israelis through a two -state solution, a solution that will never be achieved as long as we remain on a hostility with the United States of America. It is an explicit announcement of a hostility to America; This is because America alone has the keys to resolving the Palestinian issue, despite what Iran and its axis marketed from false promises to a coming military victory that we have only seen from death and displacement that received non -Palestinians.",BH

For his part, the head of the Islamic Action Front bloc, lawyer Saleh Al -Armouti, criticized the position of the Jordanian government, considering that its response was not at the required level on Trump's plans, adding: ""It was better for the government to announce its firm position through the three devices that reject the displacement and the alternative homeland."" I called it to condemn statements Trump officially, and a complaint with the International Criminal Court in The Hague to sue. Al -Armouti called on the House of Representatives to pass a draft law that prevents displacement and the alternative homeland in an urgent manner, stressing that this file is one of the priorities of Jordanian National Security.

"A few days, and hundreds of Palestinian national figures are collapsed to meet in Doha, under the umbrella of the ""Palestinian National Congress"" as ""a continuous and continuous popular movement from inside and outside the country"", ultimately aims to rebuild the Palestine Liberation Organization, as an inclusive unitary framework under a unified national leadership It addresses the tasks of the exceptional stage experienced by the people of Palestine, its national cause and its legitimate resistance.
It can be said, that the ""National Congress"" came as a culmination of several initiatives that started after October 7, from inside and outside the occupied Palestinian homeland, aimed at its entirety to resurrection and revival, and sometimes it was said ""recovery"" of the PLO, building a national reference for the Palestinian people ( The idea of ??inviting the unified leadership framework for the convening), and providing a safety network for resistance and the national project, is transcended to confront the war of cordon. Purification, genocide, annexation projects, speed, Judaization, racist separation and displacement, in Gaza first, in the West Bank, Jerusalem, and the whole of the occupied Palestinian territories in the last place.
In the background of all these initiatives, the conviction of a deep assembly lies in the fact that the PLO and the Palestinian Authority did not play their role. The natural and hoped that one of the most heinous chapters of the Zionist -imperialist war against the people, their cause, their resistance, their rights and their project, that this consensus did not prevent the variation of estimates and descriptions of the behavior of the ""official Palestinian institution"" and its performance, who said that ""deficit and negligence"" said to someone who says ""collusion"", Sometimes, the ""ribs"" in the plan to put out the resistance of the Palestinian people, in the West Bank Western as in the Gaza Strip.
This is understandable and natural, given the multiplicity of stripes and initiatives, and the difference in their political and intellectual references, as well as the variation of the political and security contexts that they work between their backs, and the accounts and connections dictated, concerns, concerns, bets and hopes.
And the variation in the backgrounds of these initiatives and their motives, led and will lead to a variation in ""bets and ceilings of expectations"", and even to create ""tensions"" about the options of the future, and any response to the critical and historical Palestinian moment with its requirements and their levels ... which puts the conference and the conference at an important crossroad Their first meeting, as three options await them, each of them will decide, The fate of this initiative, the limits of its action and its impact, and whether it will gain tactical importance - or is it a sustainable strategic impact on the overall Palestinian situation:
The shift to the ""Lobby"" pressure group, completing what was started by other pressure groups, has already grew and multiplied on the stem of the long and bitter Palestinian division, noting that the ""group"" this time, heavier weight and more, and weighs a presence, and there are national, regional and international conditions surrounding With her work, she gives her a higher ability to influence.
Thinking in this way, is completely legitimate, in which there is no objection or dust on it, and it dictates the group, choosing the tools and methods of its work that is consistent with its function, and it resorted to maximizing the idea of ??""dialogue"" and ""attempts to persuade"" the feasibility of reform, resurrection and revival, but it is The ""soft"" pressure methods do not fall in the context of its performance of its mission and its delegation that she chose for itself, and there is a need to answer Question: How can dialogue and soft pressure, lead to the change that appeared and appears to be disobedient to all initiatives and initiatives, from within the Palestinian body, and from Arab and international parties?
Many sons and daughters of the people of Palestine, and after two decades of appeals and ""pressure"" to restore unity, and four decades of initiatives aimed at ""Organization Reform Editing "", has become less confident and seriously confident this path, as the political division, which deepened institutional division, was reinforced by the geography of Gaza from the West Bank, made and made it difficult to bridge the gap and fill the gaps, which came the earthquake of October 7 to deepen it instead of burying it, Especially after the flood went away in drawing breaks and boundaries between the ends: Hamas reached an unprecedented peak In her resistance project, and the authority fell unprecedented gendarmes, in its consistency with its approach, and its consistency with the outputs of the Israeli solution, its requirements and its obligations, before the political.
Suppose that the requirements of the after -ceasefire, or after the silence of the defender in Gaza, may dictate a form of ""pleasure marriage"" between the two teams, but the failure of all multi -resource efforts, aimed at restoring reconciliation and recovering the unit, indicates that this road has become closed, And that the efforts made to open it have become a form of tampering, and that spending it in other aspects, may return with greater benefit to the people, their cause and struggle.
This is a case that needs to be thinking and management, not only by the conference and the conferences. They are only one segment, from the Palestinian people, but by the Palestinians and their friends. all.
Reducing the fate and seals of the work of this group of Palestine men and its women, to a tool for the production of ""authority/ organization"", by entering some formal reforms on its structure and performance, of the type of guarantee of a symbolic participation of this or that faction (from the organization's factions or those outside it), or modification Conditions for this current/ team is one of the currents that make up power and openness and the organization.
Although a bet like this, it involves a kind of ""risk"" if it is permissible to speak, it is possible, especially since the Palestinian experience, which is full of seasons of the scars and quotas, has kept many in the official Palestinian circle, even though their presence in the popular circle is almost ""a cubic zero "".
Here it is worth noting that the challenges that await the Palestinian people, their cause and their project are much greater than these narrow and closed accounts, and the conference that must be a major national crane, for a state of renaissance and revival, it does not have to land as it is just a negotiating tool to improve the location of this party or That, it should not be allowed to convert it into a way to ""improve the conditions of some negotiating"" with the influential leadership of the PLO
Such an approach, and to a large extent, the first approach, shakes hands And the feet of the conference and the conferences, and prevent them from fighting the serious crowding of the official leadership, on every site and inch, in the homeland and abroad, that in the battle to win public opinion, or in the conflict over the structures and infrastructure of the PLO, from popular organizations and federations, and will prolong the age of division instead of that It is shortened, and you will put the future of the Palestinian people, in the hands of leadership, which is certain of many Palestinians, that it is no longer a trusted On their representation and pronouncement in their name, they do not give them their confidence, in terms of successive surveys, and the resort to the same leadership to disrupt the general elections for their fear, which can overflow the ballot boxes, and always with arguments and excuses, apparent in it mercy and its innerness in it.
The truth is that the warning against this road/cucumber seems very necessary, and working in its early beginnings, to ensure a founding step in harmony with the national need to create a Palestinian national leadership completely expressive of the aspirations of its people and its longings, and also expressing the collective conscience of the initiatives and initiatives who will come to a portion of them, To Doha under the tent of the ""Palestinian National Congress"".
The fact that those who think (or may think) with this mentality may not constitute a majority of The attendees do not eliminate the urgent need to alert the risk of slippage to a well -known road.
It is the most difficult of all other options, for the conference and the conference to address the task of splitting a new path in front of a renewed Palestinian national movement, capable of its people, to enter the thresholds of a new strategic stage .. Here the discussion can open to two titles:
Here, the Palestinians need a ""third stream"", which can be argued with its importance and necessity, and even its insistence on the one hand, and the ability of this group (conference and conference) to be itself, this is the ""third trend.""
On the other hand, the need is appropriate for this current, but the conference is not in its composition and delegation, it is the ""legal midwife"" that you can extract to the circle of light and life .. You must search elsewhere, with other elements, some of which are among the members And that we call for and look forward to accomplishing.
This option raises questions that have been banned to this day, including; What about the ""only legal actor"", and the accumulated gains represented mainly in Arab and international confessions of the legitimacy and oneness of his representation of the Palestinian people? Is it required to build an alternative or parallel organization? What about the failed experiences and attempts that the Palestinian National Movement has gone through for ten or five years?
These questions are received, in detail and in detail, in the face of any attempt to challenge the leadership of the authority and the organization, even as they are involved in the worst policies and practices that cause the most harmful damage to its people and their cause, and invoke the worst experiences of failure and malice and the abhorrent external interventions, in order to ""break the oxidant"" in the jazz Expression, bypassing the experience of storming the resisting work factions organized Editing, in the year 1969, after the battle of dignity.
At that time, the Palestinians had two titles: Al -Shuqairi, the organization formed from the womb of the Arab official incubator, the leadership of Fatah and the other factions: the first, “official legitimacy without strong popular rules”, and the second “revolutionary legitimacy with a broad popular rule”, until the legitimacy and identification were merged into one body.
Today, with the different national, regional and international contexts, there is a similarity that does not want supporters of ""keeping the old on his foot"" recognition and referring to it: There is ""official legitimacy without popularity"", and I think that the popularity and companions of Al -Shugairi in a timely And there is ""popular resistance, not an adjective A representative official for her, ""The solution of this duality appears today, a dilemma that must be resolved if we want the Palestinian national movement to be renewed and to start towards new spaces.
The Fatah movement and Yasser Arafat did not find great trouble in achieving the marriage between the two legitimacy, for a few years. With its various schools, ""absolute evil"" from the perspective of Arab officials, and Western capitals ... these obstacles, have prevented until now, without Hamas's success in creating a pairing that has already been accomplished at lower costs, and makes its task more difficult.
One of the reasons for the failure of Hamas to create the required pairing, despite the high blood bills that prompted it, specifically in the flood, its failure to adopt a strategy based on ""partnership and participation"" with the rest of the people's components and their national movement, and their inclination as the rest of the national and Islamic work factions, to dominate and exclusively, as a kind Therefore, it was affected by the ""empowerment"" school of the style and upbringing.
Today, after the flood, we assume that the approach has changed, And to change radically, and this is what we heard from the leadership of Hamas, and what we have seen as evidence of it in the experience of the war on Gaza, are sufficient evidence to start the journey of partnership, although it was booby -trapped with doubts and possibilities.
What is required today is more than ever, going without hesitation or slowing down to form a second Palestinian address, and not to leave the ""boycott"" in Ramallah to be the only title for the Palestinian people.
It is required today, from Hamas before others, and more than others, to take the initiative on this path, and to appear already not by saying, that the logic of the partnership is the ruling logic, for the project of a ""united Palestinian national front"", which includes all the resistance factions and currents, including those in it Constant in the interior of Fatah and the Organization, and all Palestinian initiatives, personalities and gatherings in the occupied and besieged homeland and diaspora, all organizations and federations The popularity that is activated or formed, women and youth movements, academics and academies, with a special focus on the generations coming from the sons and daughters of this people.
You must find any party that is forced to visit Ramallah to deal with the Palestinian issue, to find itself compelled- at least at the end of the way- to address The second title, nothing can happen or pass, without his approval of it .. This was the case on the eve of 1969, and thus it must be awaiting the moment with which the organization and the entire Palestinian political system can be recovered.
The world should not rely on the ""pen"" suspended in the pocket of one of them, nor to the ""seal"" left in the stairs of their office, because the Palestinian people are elsewhere, and the tongue of its condition says: This situation remains from the shops, and it can open the gates of hell to the people and its cause, in particular After more than two decades, the experience of accumulated failure, which did not bring useful and did not calm down ... while the Israeli -American monster is surprising, To devour with the remaining land, rights and holy sites, and the specter of displacement hovering in the sky of the West Bank, as well as his ugly head over the people of Gaza and its owners.
This trend and choice dictates the creation of pieces and cutting with two theories, as long as they were promoted, with or without awareness, with a good or bad intent:
I think that the ""Palestinian National Congress"" can play the role of ""Catalyst"", in the creation of this second national title, he himself cannot be, and he is a minor by virtue of its composition, structure and delegating it to become ""the second title"", however it is available attic From the energies, location, and preliminary general consensus, it can work on two parallel and compatible lines:
It is okay for the conference to be a ""pressure group/ lobby"" for reconciliation, dialogue and reform, and it is inappropriate for it to be seen as a gateway to improve the location and roles, amplifying or promoting, but the historical function that must remain in the eyes of the two conferences, and others, is to address the question of leadership, renewal and gravity For the Palestinian National Movement, which qualifies it to carry out its tasks and historical physical responsibilities, now, and in the coming days, are we? Do you do?

We start our tour of the newspapers today from the Israeli Haaretz, who criticized in its opening article Israeli practices in the West Bank.
The Israeli newspaper said that the Palestinian Authority officials confirmed that about 30,000 people were already evacuated from the refugee camps in the northern West Bank while ""the army claims that there is no deliberate policy to evacuate the population, while testimonies from Palestinians in Jenin and Tulkarm indicated that these practices indicated that these practices indicated It led to large -scale evacuation for the population for very long periods compared to previous evacuation operations. ""
She added: ""Even with the absence of an organized official evacuation, the curfews, fire, destruction, cutting of electricity, and the inability to supply drink water may push the residents towards"" voluntary ""departure for the region.
While the Israeli army says that the military operation it started four weeks ago - the ""Iron Wall"" operation - targeting ""militants"" in refugee camps, ""many Palestinians believe that these operations aim to destroy these camps,"" according to the Israeli newspaper.
Haaretz also stated that this military operation started with great pressure One of the Israeli settlers over the past year, as the settlers sought to convert the West Bank into another front of the war.

The editorial indicated that after reaching the ceasefire agreement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a ""gift"" to the extremist right -wing minister in Salail Smotrich - so that he does not withdraw from his government coalition; It is a miniature transfer of some of the West Bank residents.

"The attention is directed to the emergency Arab summit that will be held on the twenty -seventh of this month in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, and is seen to be a milestone in the history of Arab positions towards the Palestinian issue.

An Arab message in the face of the Trump administration challenge

Dr. Saeed Shaheen, a professor of political media at Hebron University, is the importance of the next emergency Arab summit, despite the lack of confidence in the outcomes of the successive Arab summits and the inability of the regimes to implement its decisions.

Despite these reservations, Shaheen believes that this summit carries a glimmer of hope, and is considered a message from the Arab countries to the Trump administration challenging their will, in which it rejects the projects of displacement and resettlement that aim to liquidate the Palestinian issue at the expense of other Arab countries.

Shaheen explains that these projects have tried to impose on decades for decades for the occupation state because of their absolute bias, have been rejected and conclusively were categorized by the Arab system.

""This summit is an opportunity to show a unified and solid Arab position in the face of Trump and Netanyahu, who seek to achieve biblical prophecies about Greater Israel, and the satisfaction of Zionist fascism by adopting its positions, which are supported by the right -wing Israeli society led by Netanyahu, Bin Ghafir, and Bamliel Smotrich.

Shaheen stresses the need for the Arab summit outputs to include waving the rejection of the continued existence of American bases in the Arab region, and the threat of its vital interests in the Arab region if it continues to support Israeli policies, to present ideas contrary to the principle of the two -state solution and the Arab peace initiative and disguised to the rights of the unusable Palestinian people.

Shaheen notes that what is required of this summit is more than a diplomatic movement. Rather, it is necessary to refuse to visit Washington and threaten to cut ties with the American administration if it continues to adopt the language of threats and promises towards Arab countries, as well as strengthening relations with countries such as China, Brazil Russia and India, which is Countries that reject the American ejaculation and support the Palestinian right.

Translate data and attitudes into practical actions
The writer and political analyst Mohamed Hawash confirms that the Arab summit that will be held in Cairo at the end of this month comes at a very important time, in light of the increasing Israeli escalation and the statements of US President Donald Trump that are concerned about the projects that aim to displace the Palestinians under the slogan ""Solving the Palestinian issue "".

Hawash warns that the summit should be more than just political data or traditional positions, but rather should be translated into practical acts that pressure the Israeli occupation and fail the US President's plans.

Hawash explains that the recent statements made by Netanyahu, in which he called on Saudi Arabia to provide lands to the Palestinians to establish their state, is prepared A serious transgression of the rights of the Palestinian people and an infringement of international law.

Hawash says: ""The current Israeli policy, which strengthens Trump's positions, goes beyond even the right of the Palestinians to self -determination and establish their state on their lands, but rather seeks to solve the Palestinian problem at the expense of the Arabs and by asking them to help move the Palestinians to lands other than their lands.""

Hawash warns that the continuation of the unlimited American support for Israel means that the Arab countries are facing a major challenge in dealing with these policies, as the American administration, led by Trump, seeks to impose a new reality on the Palestinian land that reflects the interests of Israel, which threatens not only the Palestinians, but also security Arab national.

Hawash says: ""The Arab summit must clearly reject the American and Israeli statements and measures that seek to liquidate the Palestinian issue, and to reject localization and displacement projects that pose a serious threat to the Palestinian presence.""

Hawash believes that the Arab summit should not be limited to rejection only, but also witnessing a practical move represented in imposing sanctions on the Israeli occupation, and working to strengthen the internal Palestinian front, in addition to Take concrete steps to support the Palestinian economy and activate popular resistance.

Hawash confirms that the Arab countries possess many strengths that can be used in the face of the Israeli -backed Israeli project, such as the ability to control the prices of oil and gas that enter the vehicles of all manufactured goods, the strategic geographical location, as well as the large Arab market that exceeds 400 million people .

Hawash considers that the use of these papers can contribute to the face of Western support for Israel, and it constitutes an element of pressure on Western countries to reconsider their policies towards the Israeli occupation.

Hawash confirms that the Arabs today possess a great economic and strategic power through which they can face American pressure, especially since the Arab countries consider the main player in the corridors of international trade between East and West, which gives them the ability to impose their positions on the international scene.

""If Israel and the United States see it to change reality through threats and pressure, then the Arabs must unite and show strength in practical situations,"" said Hawash.

Hawash notes that the upcoming Arab summit is a decisive test The Arab world has to protect the rights of the Palestinian people, stop Israeli expansion, and confront American hegemony.

""The summit will not be just talk, the summit must be this time that translates the practical steps into diplomatic positions and economic measures that impose on Israel and the United States to respond seriously,"" says Hawash.

And he stresses that the emergency Arab summit will be decisive in determining the political future of the Palestinian issue and the Arab role in the confrontation with the Israeli threats backed by Trump.

Hawash affirms that the true power of the Arab countries is embodied in their ability to organize, plan and implement decisions that put the rights of Palestinians at the core of their priorities, and not just statements that do not bring real change on the ground.

Hawash stresses the importance of Arab countries being serious in the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip away from international pressure, stressing that the Arab countries are able to take this decision without the need for the approval of Israel or the United States.

""If the western countries, especially the United States, are trying to hinder the reconstruction of Gaza, the Arabs must take practical steps that enables them to The rebuilding of the sector in their hands, and that they explicitly announce that there is no place in the future for Western domination in the Palestinian issue. ""

Regarding the internal Palestinian situation, Hawash indicates the need for the Arab summit to push the Palestinian reconciliation and form a strong national unity among all Palestinian factions, while emphasizing the role of the PLO as a custody of the national project.

Hawash stresses the need for the Arab summit to impose a trend that leads to the abandonment of Hamas from the authority in Gaza, and to merge as a basic compound in the PLO to remove the pretexts in front of relief and reconstruction operations.

Hawash says: ""The unity of the Palestinian position is the first step towards facing Israeli plans, and there must be a unified Palestinian move, especially in light of the increasing international support for the Palestinian issue.""

A sensitive and complex stage

The writer and political analyst Mohamed Gouda explains that the upcoming Arab summit, which will be held in Cairo at the end of this month, comes in a sensitive and complex stage, in light of the ongoing developments in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and the statements that followed at the last Trump-Netanyahu summit in the White House, What the occupation is trying to impose from a new reality On the ground.

It is likely that the political discourse at the next summit will be ascending, but the most important question is: ""Will this escalation be translated into a practical move, or will the language remain traditional framework?""

Gouda notes that the current data indicate attempts to introduce a new language that reflects the deteriorating reality, with the possibility of escalating statements, but it confirms that the actual outputs will remain dependent on the balances of Arab interests.

""Today, it is not enough to issue statements of condemnation or emphasis on the constants, but rather practical decisions are required to be translated into actual steps that support Palestinian steadfastness and impose a cost on the occupation in exchange for its aggressive policies.""

Gouda notes that Israel is seeking to impose a de facto policy, by displacing the Palestinians and changing the demographic character of the Palestinian territories, including Gaza, the West Bank and Jerusalem, especially in the wake of US President Donald Trump's statements about displacement and possession of Gaza.

Jouda confirms that facing these ambitions requires working on several levels, Palestinian, Arab and international.

Gouda stresses the need to strengthen Palestinian national unity to confront the occupation plans and activate the popular resistance in various Its forms, as well as strengthening economic and social resilience, and that the Palestine Liberation Organization and its government assume fully responsible for the Gaza Strip as an integral part of the Palestinian state.

It calls on the quality of the Arab countries to shift from the circle of denunciation to take practical steps, such as imposing economic sanctions on the occupation, activating the tools of political and diplomatic pressure, as well as supporting the Palestinians financially and logistically, and pressure for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip.

Joudeh notes the importance of investing the increasing international support for the Palestinian issue, working to pursue the occupation legally in international courts, and strengthening international alliances with countries rejecting Israeli policies.

And Jouda confirms that facing the Zionist ambitions requires a shift in action and not only in statements, as the occupation takes advantage of the absence of decisive responses to pass its aggressive plans.

A fundamental shift in the positions of Arab countries

The professor of political science, Dr. Suhail Diab, believes that the emergency meeting that the Arab League called on the 27th of this month reflects a unified Arab position in the face of American-Israeli plans to re-draw the map of the Middle East to serve Israeli interests alone.

Diab explains that this step represents a fundamental shift in the positions of the Arab countries, especially the Saudi-Egyptian-Jordanian axis, which seeks to strengthen its role in the balance of regional powers, and reject any attempts aimed at displacing the Palestinian people or imposing unilateral solutions.

Diab believes that this articulated stage must express an Arab consensus on the rejection of any plan to displace the Palestinians or impose an ""alternative homeland"" in any of the Arab countries, as this is a direct threat to national security for each country separately, and the Arab national security in general.

Diab notes that the statements of US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on this issue are an existential threat to the region, due to its repercussions on Arab national societies and the stability of existing political systems.

Diab notes that this development represents the beginning of the disintegration of the traditional strategic alliance between some Arab countries and the United States, as the Arab countries have begun to realize the importance of adopting a more independent foreign policy, by diversifying their international alliances and opening up to other forces such as China, Russia, and Iran, along with Reinforcement Cooperation with European countries to confront extremist American policies.

This shift is expected to lead to the emergence of new understandings between the Arab axis and two major axes in the region, namely Türkiye and Iran, with the aim of facing the common existential threats imposed by American and Israeli policies.

At the international level, Diab indicates that Trump's policies were not limited to the Middle East, but also extended to crises with many countries in the world, as these policies seek to destabilize economic, security and military stability globally, to undermining international institutions such as the United Nations and UNESCO, International Criminal Court.

Diab explains that Trump and Netanyahu are working to form a new global system based on extremist right -wing rule, seeking to impose a specific political and economic model on all countries.

Diab believes that the Arab position rejecting these plans intersects with the interests of many affected countries, which may open the door for new international alliances to confront these trends.

Diab emphasizes the importance of basic steps to confront the planning for the Palestinian displacement, to move immediately to block the road in front of these plans before it is too late.

It indicates The priority must be for the reunification of the Palestinian ranks by forming a temporary technocrat that includes all Palestinian factions, including the Palestinian Authority, the PLO, Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
Diab stresses the necessity of jointly reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, to ensure the stability of the internal situation and prevent any attempts to impose external solutions.

It calls for the crystallization of an Arab political project, and possibly wider Islamic, aimed at supporting the Palestinian issue at the international level, by pressuring international institutions and international legitimacy to recognize the rights of Palestinians and emphasize the two -state solution.

Diab indicates the need to work on building a broad international alliance that includes Arab countries, the Islamic world, the European Union, and Latin America, in addition to the countries affected by Trump's policies such as Canada and Mexico.

Diab confirms that international institutions, such as the United Nations and human rights organizations, can play a decisive role in this alliance to stop US-Israeli plans and restore balance to the international system.

Diab stresses that this moment represents a historical opportunity for the Arab world to rebuild its alliances and prove its role as a major actor In international politics, instead of being satisfied with the role of the recipient of decisions.

Diab confirms that these developments may lead to a fundamental change in the balance of global powers, which calls for new Arab strategies to face future challenges.

A different summit from its predecessors

The writer and political analyst Awni Al -Mishni considers that the Arab Summit at the end of this month will be different from its predecessor from the tops, explaining that the current threats facing Arab countries are not limited to the Palestinian people only, but also include clearly and explicitly the national interests of Arab countries, especially Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

Al -Mishni explains that the Israeli ambitions have become more clear, as Israeli and Israeli officials speak about their ambitions in Jordanian, Syrian, Lebanese, Iraqi and Egyptian lands, which reflects their intentions not only with aspirations, but also to seek to achieve them.

Al -Mishni stresses that the displacement of the Palestinians, which Israel promotes, is a direct threat to many Arab national interests, including Egyptian and Jordanian interests.

Al -Mishni says: ""The next Arab summit will be held in light of this great threat, and it will be at the level of this The danger, just as the summit will revolve around protecting the national interests of these countries, and not only solidarity with the Palestinian people, ""noting that the summit will present new positions related to these interests.

Al -Mishni notes that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia faces a difficult position after US President Donald Trump's endeavor to pressure Saudi Arabia to finance the displacement plans.

Al -Mishni says: ""Saudi Arabia today is in a position that cannot accept the continuation of normalization under these American and Israeli policies.""

Al -Mishni believes that ""the next Arab summit will be to send a message that the Arab countries will not be subject to American pressure, and that the Arab climate is now ready to accommodate these positions.""

Al -Mishni explains that the Arab regimes, despite their historical relations with the United States, will not be able to remain subject to American pressure.

Al -Mishni says: ""The upcoming summit language will be different from the previous summits; it will be more clear and less mysterious, and will reflect more practical positions, which will contribute to achieving the minimum demands of the Palestinian people.""

As for facing Zionist ambitions in Arab lands, Al -Mishni confirms that what is required of the Arab countries is A unified and clear position.

Al -Mishni says: ""Despite the weakness and fragmentation of the Arab situation, the Arab world has many capabilities that can stop these ambitions, such as oil, geographical location, international relations, and popular will.""

Al -Mishni stresses that the Palestinian people have held a 15 -month in the face of the Israeli occupation, and this reflects the ability of the Arab nation to confront if it unites and unites its positions.

Al -Mishni stresses that what is required is a unified Arab position that does not allow the Israeli occupation to infiltrate the Arab region without achieving a just peace.

Al -Mishni says: ""The Palestinians must be granted their basic rights, foremost of which is the establishment of their independent state and its capital, Al -Quds Al -Sharif, in the entire West Bank and Gaza Strip.""

Al -Mishni stresses that the next Arab summit must be a lever for the Arab position in the face of Zionist ambitions, pointing out that the Arab countries and Arab peoples possess a lot of capabilities to support the Palestinian issue and to stop the Israeli expansion in the region.

If the Arabs do not reject Trump's scheme, it will not be stability

The writer and political analyst Imad Moussa believes that the upcoming Arab summit carries an agenda An American aims to give legitimacy to the new Syrian authority, a step in line with what he described as ""renewable authorities"" that work for American interests in the region.

Moussa believes that there are American attempts to control Syrian gas and oil by controlling its marketing and prices, a step that seeks to exclude Russian gas and strangle the Chinese economy, in addition to forcing Iran to waive its nuclear program and support it for the ""Axis of Resistance"".

Moussa believes that the Arab summit operates according to this American agenda, especially after the Syrian government recently took measures indicating that it is going in this direction.

Moussa notes that this is part of the plans aimed at strengthening American hegemony in the region.

Moussa believes that the summit will also address the decision of US President Donald Trump to displace the people of Gaza to Jordan and Egypt, a definite decision aimed at controlling gas and oil resources in the region, which creates great tensions in Jordan and Egypt.

Moussa explains that the biggest challenge facing the official Arab regime and the Arab peoples is to stand unified against this dangerous American decision on the displacement of the people of Gaza, which threatens Palestinian rights means the displacement of part of the Palestinian people from its historical land.

Moussa warns that the Arab division in this file will destabilize the region, saying: ""If the unified Arab rejection of Trump's decision to deport is not achieved, then there will be no safety or stability in the region.""

Moussa calls for the summit to be a turning point in Arab positions towards the major challenges facing the Palestinian issue, warning of the consequences of the continued Arab indole in confronting American projects that threaten regional security.",PS

"Six Arab countries confirmed during a meeting held in Cairo on the first of February, their rejection of theses and projects aimed at ""displacing the Palestinians"" outside their lands and under any circumstance.
The meeting of the foreign ministers of Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the State of Qatar, the Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the Secretary -General of the League of Arab States, in response to the invitation of US President Donald Trump to displace the population of the Palestinian Gaza Strip to Egypt, And Jordan.
In a clear message from the six Arab countries, the declared statement at the conclusion of the Cairo administration’s meeting urged the Trump administration to seek to achieve the final solution to the Palestinian issue and the Arab -Israeli conflict according to the principle of the “two -state solution” through which permanent and fair peace in the Middle East can be achieved.
The topic of the call to ""displace the Palestinians"" is not new in the record of the struggle that extends for more than seven decades between the Arab-Palestinian and Israel side; Which occupies all Palestinian territories, the Golan Heights, Jabal Al -Sheikh, and many other regions of Syria.
Since 1948 and attempts to displace Palestinians from their lands, both by a state The occupation, or by other continuous countries, and each stage of the conflict was targeting the Palestinian presence on its soil, and was framework for facades that created the means of international and regional presence in the media and political; Sometimes the requests for displacement are security or political motives, or others, and always the Palestinian, Arab and international position was rejection.
Despite Israel's attempts during the 1948 war, about 750,000 Palestinians of their homes were displaced as a result of the military operations of the gangs associated with the Zionist movement at the time, which caused the destruction of hundreds of Palestinian villages and forced its people to displace them, and since that date the issue of Palestinian refugees was a major humanitarian humanitarian problem that the international community rejected, despite pressure Which was practiced by leaders of the Zionist movement at the time because the Palestinian refugees did not return To their homes, the United Nations issued Resolution 194, which affirms the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes, which has not yet been implemented.
After the six -day war in 1967, in which Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, it led to the displacement of about 245,000 Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip to Jordan, and towards 11 thousand from the Gaza Strip to Egypt, and 116 thousand Palestinians and Syrians from the Golan Heights to Syria, as these countries constitute a geographical extension of the aforementioned areas.
In the eighties of the last century, and during the first Palestinian uprising (1987-1993), calls from some Israeli politicians to displace the Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip appeared, one of the most prominent advocates of that Israeli politician Rehavam Zeevi, who proposed the ""deportation"" of the Palestinians to other Arab countries .
These calls faced widespread criticism from the international community, and were rejected by the Arab countries. Then the Oslo agreements signed on September 13, 1993 came to confirm the necessity of resolving the Palestinian issue through negotiations and not through ""displacement"".
The Arab Summit in Beirut in 2002 adopted the Arab Peace Initiative, which was presented by the late Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, when he was the crown prince, which guarantees the achievement of peace in the Middle East between Israel and the Palestinians on the basis of the establishment of an internationally recognized Palestinian state on the 1967 borders. And the return of refugees and withdrawing from the occupied Syrian Golan Heights, in exchange for recognition and normalization Relations between all Arab countries with Israel.
The Israeli response to this initiative in the tongue of Ariel Sharon, the then Israeli Prime Minister, was to reject the proposal categorically on the basis that it requires Israel to accept a large number of Palestinian refugees, and that it exceeds the Israeli ""red lines"".
The issue of forced displacement of the Palestinians from their homes and homeland has extended from 1948 until today; Displacement calls are often issued by Israeli and American politicians.
Although the Palestinian refugees enjoy the right to return to their homes from which they were displaced under Resolution 194 issued by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, as well Refugee conditions in 1951, the occupying country completely ignores all of this Its dealings of the Palestinian people, and always seeks to achieve its goal to evacuate the land of Palestine from the Palestinians.
US President Donald Trump, in his first term 2017-2021 What was called the ""Deal of the Century"", but this was not achieved during his first age.
But the 15 -month war of Gaza put this issue in its priorities for the current presidential period, so he launched its proposal to transfer the Palestinians from Gaza and the occupied West Bank to Egypt and the neighboring Jordan under any circumstance Its accredited all over the world between countries.
This requires the response of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al -Sisi and the Jordanian monarch Abdullah bin Al -Hussein, where the Egyptian President said during a joint press conference with his guest, Kenyan President William Roto: ""Egypt will not participate in the displacement of the Palestinian people as"" historical injustice, and added: ""It is not possible to leniency Or allow the displacement of the Palestinians due to its impact on the Egyptian national security and Arab national security, ""noting that"" what happened since the seventh of October, until Now it is the result of the repercussions of not reaching the solution of the Palestinian issue. ""
In turn, Jordan affirmed, through its foreign minister, Ayman Al -Safadi, that ""Jordan's position on the displacement of the Palestinians"" is not changing and necessary to achieve stability and peace. What we all want.
US President Donald Trump may go to the threat of economic sanctions against the countries that reject its proposal, especially Egypt and Jordan, which suffer from difficult economic conditions, but the strength of the position of allied countries of Washington, led by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey, will keep the doors of dialogue and communication open With the White House.
Consequently, the language of interests, if it is better to use, with all international demands supporting the solution of the Arab -Israeli conflict through the portal (two -state solution) can give Trump a better vision to retract his proposal and replace it at the invitation of an international conference to rebuild Gaza.
The positions of the Arab countries rejecting the idea of ??displacing the Palestinians proposed by US President Donald Trump on the displacement of the people of the Gaza Strip to Egypt and Jordan, indicating the unity of this position based on legal, political and academic references, and also confirms that the solution of the Palestinian issue must take place through negotiations, and according to decisions International, while respecting the right of the Palestinians to return and live on their soil, and this position has reached completely clearly to the White House, and to the Prime Minister of the occupation state, Benjamin Netanyahu.
It is also remarkable in the Arab position that some Arab countries that are not printed with Israel offered the establishment of a Palestinian state in exchange for normalization with it, such as Algeria, for example, whose president, Abdul Majeed Taboun, said: His country is ready to normalize its relations with Israel on the day when a full Palestinian state is establishing.
While the chances of normalization between Riyadh and Tel Aviv, which Trump sought in his first term, decreases for not achieving what the Kingdom requested regarding the two -state solution and the return of Palestinian refugees to their homes.
The Arab position is pushing two directions: the first rejects the issue of displacing the Palestinians categorically, and the second is to open the prospects for peace and global and regional peace through the establishment of a Palestinian state over its entire soil with the limits of the six -day war in 1967, and a full Arab normalization with Israel.

Al -Mughni stressed in a speech during the National Congress, the need to hold a national meeting to unify the Palestinian ranks in order to address the projects of the displacement plans aimed at liquidating the Palestinian issue.
He explained that Gaza is the legitimacy of the Palestinian, which has withstood and patience and made clear for the Palestinian project and address the occupation plans aimed at displacing our people from its land and country.
Al -Mukhtar Al -Mughni asked about the role of the authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization, which is hatched against the Palestinian issue and the displacement plans, saying: ""Throughout the war, we have not heard of anyone within the organization and the authority supporting the Gaza Strip.""
Al -Mukhtar Al -Hajj Abu Salman called for the necessity of inviting members of the Executive Organization of the PLO to hold a national conference on the ground of the Gaza Strip, in order to arrange the Palestinian house to address the plans that are being hatched to the displacement of the Palestinians.
The displacement project will not pass!

"The Palestinians responded to the proposals of US President Donald Trump to displace, liquidate and seize their rights, in a resounding response from Gaza and the West Bank.

Muhammad Abdul Rahman, who lost his brother in the last bombing, saw that Trump's statements are not just words, but an extension of an ancient American policy that supports the occupation with all its power, “Israel does not fight Hamas as they claim ...

"In a world governed by strategic interests and geographical policies, US President Donald Trump has sparked widespread controversy with his plan to displace 2.2 million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Egypt and Jordan.
This plan, which was justified in phrases such as ""cleansing"" of Gaza from its residents after a 15 -month destroyer, faces major legal and international obstacles, inspired by historical strategies that had previously failed to achieve its goals.
In this article, we review the legal dimensions of this controversial plan, and shed light on historical attempts of forced displacement, and we discuss the mechanisms through which Egypt and Jordan can, along with the international community, address these plans, with a focus on promoting the steadfastness of the Palestinians as a strategic option that preserves their rights And their national identity.
The statements of US President Donald Trump regarding a plan to deport Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt and Jordan in a complex international context characterized by escalating tensions in the Middle East, where Gaza witnessed repeated Israeli wars that led to the deterioration of humanitarian conditions.
These statements were associated with the plan of the ""Deal of the Century"" launched by Trump as part of a political settlement aimed at strengthening the interests of Israel by providing promises Economic for the Palestinians without meeting their legitimate political rights, which was widely rejected.
It also coincided with the Trump administration pushing towards signing normalization agreements between Israel and a number of Arab countries (Abraham Conventions), which contributed to reducing pressure on Israel towards the Palestinian issue. Internationally, the plan came in light of American tensions with Iran, which supports the Palestinian armed factions in Gaza, with the aim of weakening Iranian influence in the region.
Internally, Trump was seeking to enhance his popularity in his pro -Israel base, especially evangelical Christians, in the context of preparing for the elections, while exerting pressure on Egypt and Jordan to assume additional responsibilities towards Palestinian refugees, in a way that reduces Israel any political, economic or security burdens.
History has witnessed multiple attempts to deport the Palestinians or resettle them outside their homeland, all of which have failed to achieve their goals due to political complications and popular resistance.
Among the most prominent of these attempts is the settlement project in Sinai in 1955, which was proposed by Israel with British and American support to resettle Palestinian refugees in North Sinai, but it faced a firm Egyptian rejection led by Gamal Abdel Nasser and an opposition Stead Palestinian.
Attempts to settle the Palestinians in Jordan also emerged during the 1960s and 1970s, which caused the escalation of tension between the Palestinian factions and the Jordanian regime, and ended with the events of September in 1970.
Likewise, the United Nations and Western countries have put forward plans such as international resettlement programs via ""UNRWA"", which called for the resettlement of the Palestinians in host countries in exchange for financial support, but they met a decisive rejection of Palestinian refugees who adhered to the right to return, and the Arab countries that were afraid of liquidating the Palestinian cause or Polishing political balance. The reasons for the failure of these attempts are due to the Palestinian adherence to his national rights, and the Arab countries refused to hold them responsible for resolving the issue on behalf of Israel.
For decades, Israel has sought to displace the Palestinians, especially in the Gaza Strip, using security and military excuses to evacuate residential areas and create a demographic change that serves its strategic interests. These attempts began early, but they appeared clearly during a military operation called the steadfast shelf in 2014, as the occupation army targeted the northern Gaza Strip, such as Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia, with intense bombing, with warnings to the residents to evacuate Their homes. Despite a temporary displacement of some families to shelter centers, most of the population returned upon the end of the fighting, which led to the failure of Israel's attempt to make a permanent demographic change.
In subsequent years, the Israeli targets became more clear through the statements of prominent officials, confirming the endeavor to displace or liquidate Palestinians. For example, the Israeli National Security Minister, Etamar bin Ghaffir, called for ""resettlement of hundreds of thousands of Gaza population"", while the Minister of Finance in Salail Smotrich supported measures aimed at a demographic change in the Strip. These statements sparked widespread international condemnation and described as evidence of Israeli intentions to make a fundamental change in the demographic Gaza composition.
During the last war on Gaza in 2023, Israeli attempts to achieve these goals escalated. Israel also explicitly announced its aim to evacuate the northern Gaza Strip by allegedly eliminating the resistance tunnels and the Hamas infrastructure. As Israel resorted to the use of intense bombing and mass warning to force the population to go to the south.
Despite the severity of the bombing and the targeting of large areas such as Jabalia, Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun, as well as health infrastructure Especially Kamal Adwan Hospital, the Palestinians resisted these pressures, considering that the evacuation paves the process of permanent forced displacement. With the ends of the operations, the residents gradually returned to their homes, showing Israel's failure to impose a permanent demographic change.
In this context, the Israeli historian Beni Morris highlights in his writings, such as ""1948 and then"" and ""Nakba: The story of the Arab-Israeli conflict"", that the Israeli policies towards the Palestinians have always included the element of forced displacement as part of a strategic plan.
Morris notes that the Palestinian displacement during the Nakba in 1948 was not merely a result of the war, but rather was part of a deliberate policy of ethnic cleansing with the aim of reducing the number of Arab population within the occupied territories. It also confirms that subsequent attempts, including the major wars such as the steadfast shelf and the war on Gaza in 2023, were aimed at achieving Israeli demographic hegemony, but failed due to Palestinian steadfastness and international pressure.
In addition to the military operations, an investigation of Amnesty International indicated that Israel is committing acts that amount to genocide, including deliberate killing and physical and psychological harm to the population, in addition to being subjected to them For harsh living conditions aimed at destroying them. These policies reflect a clear Israeli attempt to liquidate the Palestinian presence in Gaza through a mixture of displacement and genocide.
Israel's attempts to deport the Palestinians, despite its fierceness and continuous escalation, revealed a permanent deficit in achieving its goals. This is due to the steadfastness of the Palestinians and their insistence on adhering to their land.
International law categorically rejects forced displacement, based on major texts condemning these practices in times of war and peace. The Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 stipulates in Article 49 the ban on the forced transportation of the population from the occupied lands, and Article 147 describes forced displacement as a serious violation and war crime.
The statute of the International Criminal Court (Rome 1998) also strengthens this position, where Article 8 (2) (B) (8) (8) criminalizes illegal displacement, while Article 7 (1) (d) is forced displacement a crime against humanity if it is widely done. Domain or methodology.
In addition, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights stresses the right of individuals to freedom of movement and choose their place By force and ensuring the right of Palestinian refugees to return.
The displacement of the Palestinians is not only a flagrant violation of international law, but also means liquidating the Palestinian cause and burying the aspirations of the Palestinian people in building their state.
How can we talk about a Palestinian state without a people on the ground? Whether in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, or Jerusalem, the displacement aims to uproot the Palestinian people from its historical roots and turn the land into a fully Israeli settlement project, which makes any path towards a two -state solution impossible.
International laws provide a strong framework for the condemnation of forced displacement, as their texts are a reference to impose political and diplomatic pressure on Israel through international organizations such as the United Nations and the International Criminal Court.
However, the application of this law faces great challenges; The absence of effective implementation mechanisms depends heavily on the cooperation of states, which makes the implementation of rulings difficult in the event that the accused parties refuse to commit.
In addition, there is duplication of international standards where the major powers such as the United States protect Israel from international sanctions, as is documented in many decisions that have been withheld in Security Council.
The current geopolitical environment places barriers to a sufficient international consensus to impose sanctions, as happened in the United Nations General Assembly, where some countries refused to recognize displacement as a crime. To achieve actual success, international political will must be strengthened, increased popular and legal pressure, and the exploitation of legal platforms to raise coherent issues that expose these practices and put Israel under international accountability. Without this, international law will remain a powerful tool on paper, but it is in reality.
Both Egypt and Jordan oppose any attempts to forced displacement of the Palestinians as a flagrant violation of international law, especially the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, which prohibits the forced transport of the population, and the statute of the International Criminal Court that classifies forced displacement as a crime of war and a crime against humanity. It also contradicts the axioms of Arab national security and its title to support the Palestinian issue.
The two countries previously rejected similar plans because of its direct impact on internal stability in them, in addition to the failure of Israel or its Western allies to bring political solutions acceptable.
Egypt and Jordan's official and diplomatic positions With clear statements, it increases international pressure on Israel and exposes it to wide criticism, which supports the steadfastness of the Palestinians on their land and prevents the granting of any political cover for attempts to displace.
In practice, Egypt and Jordan can take studied steps to prevent the implementation of any forced displacement plans. The border monitoring must be strengthened to ensure that the Palestinians are not forcibly displaced, while ensuring a safe and sustainable flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza to alleviate the economic and humanitarian pressures that may push the population to displace.
In this context, Egypt, in particular, should face Israeli and American pressure that may hinder the entry of aid or the transit of individuals for humanitarian purposes.
The two countries also have to support Palestinians within the sector through cooperation with international organizations, while activating regional and international coordination through the League of Arab States and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to mobilize a unified Arab position that enhances Israel's isolation on the international scene.
These efforts prevent any demographic changes in Gaza and keep the Palestinian issue in the circle of international attention, while emphasizing the right of the Palestinians to return.

""Middle East Eye"" to Terry British US President Donald's plan
Trump
, To displace the residents of the sector
Gaza
.
The writer said that the so -called Gaza ""cleaning"" plan is consistent with the long -time thinking of the Zionist movement, and more accurately, with the goals of the war set by the extremist Israeli right.
He added: ""This ethnic cleansing will pave the way for Jewish colonial colonial projects, and to turn Gaza into a technological center for everything related to the future, which is still dreaming of Netanyahu.""
He explained: ""Through this plan, Trump is identical to the long -term movement of Zionism, more precisely, with the goals of the war that the extremist right was placed in Israel.""
The following is the text of the article:
On Sunday, US President Donald Trump proposed resettlement of one and a half million Palestinians from Gaza residents in Jordan or in Iraq, as part of a plan for ""only cleaning"" the sector. Rather, his private envoy to the Middle East suggested Steve Wittouf resettling part of the Gaza population in Indonesia.
In a tweet via the X platform, Itamar Bin Ghaffir, the far -right and the former National Security Minister in Israel, expressed his support for the Trump proposal.
Bin Ghafir wrote: ""One of our demands by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to encourage voluntary immigration. When the head of the largest major power in the world suggests this idea, this deserves the Israeli government to implement it - encouraging immigration now.""
This ethnic cleansing will pave the way for Jewish colonial projects and transform Gaza into a technology center for everything related to the future, which is still dreaming of Netanyahu.
Through this plan, Trump is identical to the long -term movement of Zionism, more precisely, with the goals of the war that the extremist right was placed in Israel.
On the twentieth of December, Bin Ghafir had again mentioned his proposal, which is to ""encourage voluntary immigration"" for the inhabitants of Gaza so that the Palestinian region, from which the Israelis withdrew in 2005.
And from his point of view it is an urgent necessity to preserve the security of Israel, as it is a better solution for the residents residing in Gaza, and he said: ""Gaza is unhealthy, while other countries need the workforce, and therefore it is better for them to be there.""
That was not the first time since the war on October 7, 2023, was proposed In which the far -right minister has this idea.
For example, on the fourteenth of May 2024, Bin Ghafir made his proposal within a human framework, when he said: ""Encourage the voluntary migration of the residents of Gaza ... that is moral, and it is a rational choice, and it is also right.""
The ""return"" of the Jews to Gaza will be an investigation of a prophecy and fairness of the Jewish people, which was expressed by Bin Ghafir by saying: ""We must return to the homeland, because that is what the Torah requires, and that is the moral work, and that is historical justice, that is Logic, and that is the right verb. ""
On the same occasion, he went further than that, Israeli parliament member Zafi Sokut, a member of the Zionist Religious Party, went when he said: “Tell the countries of the world who sympathize with morality in hydrophia with the Gazans that they [that is, the Palestinians of Gaza] will be safer with them in other countries. If they are They love them to this extent, South Africa should take the inhabitants of Jabalia. ""
As is evident from Sunday's comments, the ceasefire did not change fundamentally from this vision, which dates back to the origin of Zionism.
One hundred thousand Arabs in Gaza, not 2 million
Despite some dissatisfaction by the Israeli opposition and even the states United in President Joe Biden, but again in the history of Israeli colonialism, the project is pushed through the war, within the policy of imposing the fait accompli.
In particular, this was the situation in northern Gaza, where the army regularly implemented a plan to expel, exterminate and resettle the Palestinians, pursuant to the recommendations that were received in the so -called Island plan, or the general plan, which was developed by a group of senior reserve officers in order to purify the area ethnically.
There is no doubt that for many Israeli leaders, leaving the majority of the Palestinians of Gaza is the logical result of military operations, even if it is gradually achieved.
This was not hidden by Finance Minister Paisalel Smotrich in a statement issued in December 2023, when he said: ""What should happen in the Gaza Strip is to encourage immigration."" He added: ""If the Arab population in Gaza was one hundred or two hundred thousand, instead of two million, then the discussion about the next day will be completely different.""
The idea has become part of the general debate inside Israel, according to an opinion poll that was presented early in 2024 in a conference organized under the title ""Lessons from Gaza - the end of the idea of ??a solution The two countries, ""in response to the question"" Are you with or against the voluntary displacement of the inhabitants of the Gaza Strip to other countries? "", 76 percent of the poll participants said they support this - and this is a majority that represents all components of the political spectrum.
The fact that the Israeli public is asked to report what the Palestinians will want to reveal the extent to which these Palestinians are stripped of their right to be active in making their history.
It is not surprising that the Israelis have the desire to see the Arabs disappear and leave the scene empty in front of the Jewish state that includes Gaza and the West Bank and even the Syrian Golan Heights and the southern West Bank of the Litani River in Lebanon. However, the idea of ??""voluntary"" migration, on the other hand, seems more contradictory.
If we take into account the violence practiced for the starvation of the population, the systematic destruction of all the infrastructure necessary for life, and the elimination of any possibility of a future return to northern Gaza, the idea of ??""voluntary"" departure seems as if it was a term derived from the eu -language dictionary.
They fold their tents and leave silently
However, this is still part of the selection of the means that the founding fathers of the state thought Judaism, as witnessed by the research work carried out by the British Palestinian historian Nour Masalha about the continuity of ""the concept of transistor in Zionist political thought.""
Through the slogan ""Land without a people for a people without a land"", which is the slogan that Israel formulated Zanguel, one of the first organizers of the Zionist movement in Britain, the Zionist leaders sought to deny the existence of a resident people in that land.
However, the Arab presence has been considered an obstacle. This was expressed by Zanguel himself through a false claim in 1916, when he claimed, as he was quoted as a reconciliation, that ""removing the Arabs from Palestine to provide the necessary space to settle the European Jewish masses is a prerequisite for achieving Zionism.""
In a vision packed with Orientalist biases, Zanguel wrote in 1920 saying: “We cannot allow the Arabs to impeding a very valuable piece of historical redevelopment ... And accordingly, we must gently persuade them to immigrate. In the end, they have all the Arabian Peninsula with its area of ??one million Square. Silently, let them comply with that now. ""
However, the dreamer that The Arabs who are from the ancient Hebrews want to return to their ancient religion, as Ben Gurion wrote in 1918 before the idea was erased from the Zionist narrative, or, in contrast to that, that they are not related to the land ""which was promised"" to the Jewish people, according to the formula that Without Herzl in 1895 in his memoirs, he was dispersed to give way to a more realistic understanding.
Indeed, there was no chance that the Arabs could voluntarily give up Jewish immigrants for fertile lands that they still have unlawful after generation.
""The Arab tribes were removed with the sword,"" as Zanguel expressed in 1905 was not an option, due to the lack of the necessary power. Consequently, the minds of the leaders of the Zionist movement occupied the following question: How can the Arabs of Palestine be pregnant, whose national awareness was growing and strengthened by the tensions resulting from the extraction of the land from them, to leave ""voluntarily"".

Do not leave them with an option other than immigration
This reached the peak in 1937 when the Bill committee, which was sent by the British government after the Arab Revolution in 1936, proposed on the one hand dividing Palestine into two states, and on the other hand the transfer of the Arab population to Outside the area designated for the Jewish state.
After a fierce discussion, the Zurich Conference of the Zionist Global Organization rejected a plan that restricts the movement's expansionist ambitions, which claimed the right to Palestine as a whole, without commitment to the British government to deploy forces that guarantee the completion of the transportation process.
The Zionist leaders did not mean the phrase ""voluntary"" immigration that gave individuals freedom of choice, but rather the result that resulted from a set of measures that have no choice but to immigrate.
As Malah is mentioned, Johuhua Subarsky, the leader of the public Zionists in Palestine, suggested that by overseeing citizenship within the state during the transitional period, imposing agricultural legislation, which is intended to confiscate large areas of Arab lands and prevent Arabs from buying the land inside the country, a huge number of The Arabs will leave the land of Israel. ""
Perlene, leader of the Zionist Zionist Party, suggested to her, Knesset Zeral and a member of the Zionist Labor Committee, that taxes should be increased until the Arabs are forced to flee because of the burden of taxes. ""
It was not the approval of individuals that they were seeking to obtain, but rather the approval of the leaders of the neighboring Arab countries, who were subjected to By the British Empire, such as Abdullah bin Al -Hussein (Emir of Eastern Jordan) or his brother Faisal bin Al -Hussein (King of Iraq), who was not in front of the financial aid he received only to agree to welcome this new population bloc.
One of the most sophisticated plans, which have received great attention from the Zionist leaders, as well as from the American and British authorities alike, until the mid-1940s, is the one that Edward A Norman (1900-1955), a Jewish billionaire residing in New York, has developed his wealth. And his political activity to support the Jewish population in Palestine before 1948, according to what was mentioned.
His idea was to organize resettlement in the Shatt al -Ghrouf, which is located in the heart of the fertile plains of Iraq, instead of the eastern bank of the Jordan River, which, according to it, should not be given the Jews and become forever outside their colonial region. Looking at the number of Jews who need migration from Europe, they are expected to need it.
The purpose of some of these projects was to have a human nature, but they are actually weaving fiction. It was not taking into account the awareness of the Palestinians And their sense of belonging to Earth.
The idea that Ben Gurion formulated, for example in 1941, according to which the land of Israel is just a small piece of land inhabited by the Arabs, and that the Arabs in the land of Israel are just a very small group of Arabic -speaking peoples, it is one of the permanent characteristics of the Zionist understanding The Palestinian Arabs are linked to their land.
Tensions resulting from the expulsion of the Palestinians through a terrorist campaign that led its leaders, starting in 1947, the Zionist militias, the Ergon, Stern and the Haganah, finally led to the confrontation in 1948 between Israel and the neighboring Arab countries (
Egypt
Syria, Jordan and race).
Three quarters of the Arabs who lived in the land of the Jewish state (which expanded during the events) were expelled, and thus the ""Arab Question"" miraculously was resolved, in most cases.
Then the Israeli propaganda later fabricated the ""voluntary"" legend of the Palestinians at the invitation of Arab leaders, to leave the field open to military operations to return after achieving victory. As they have suffered a defeat, they lost any legitimate right to return to their homeland. This is a legend that the Palestinian historians have not They entered it, then they joined them with the so -called new historians in Israel.
After 1967, Gaza emptying
The Arab issue emerged at other times after the 1967 war and the resulting new occupations, including the Gaza Strip. Odir Adirit, a journalist in Haretz, documented Israeli plans to transfer the residents of the recently invaded areas. Once again, Israeli rulers sought to obtain a ""voluntary migration"" to Sinai or Jordan, to keep only seventy thousand or one hundred thousand Palestinians in Gaza.
Aderet wrote that the idea of ??the Israeli Prime Minister, Levi Ashkol, was serving a quiet migration in a way that does not seem to have been related to the matter.
He adds that the Israelis, with their security background, who were aware of the Palestinian society, were sent directly to the population gatherings in Gaza in order to persuade its leaders to encourage people to leave voluntary. The Prime Minister believed that the Arabs may have gone out of the sector automatically due to the suffocating situation and the siege they were exposed to there.
But the Palestinians of Gaza have remained steadfast, do not affect these attempts.
In 1971, Defense Minister Moshe Dayan formulated a faster version of ""voluntary"" immigration, saying: ""will We give them 48 hours to leave, and we will tell them, for example, you will move to Al -Arish [in Sinai] or anywhere else, we will provide you with transportation. Initially, they give them a voluntary transition option. Leave the house from the furniture. If a person does not come to arrange his conditions - we bring the bulldozer to demolish the house.
If there are people inside the house, we take them out of it. Since we give them 48 hours, there is no critical moment here when it comes and says we and your furniture will carry you in the truck, but you give them the opportunity to do this voluntarily. ""
This process remembers what the Spanish invaders were doing in the face of the indigenous people in pre -Colombia civilizations. Where before heading towards the battle, they read a list of conditions on them and suggested that they convert to the Catholic religion, which is completely strange to their world.
If they refused, the Spaniards threatened them, saying: ""We will invade you by force, we will launch a war for you everywhere, and in all ways."" Given that the indigenous people were refusing, this considered this a declaration of the demonic natures, which was justifying dealing with them with the most severe types of violence, and considered it a legal and moral practice.

We can recall from this historical glimpse of the fixed specifications of the idea of ??""voluntary migration"". It is based on denying the right of the other to have a vision that expresses it or aspirations that it is aspired to, but rather that it is destroyed in the face of what is being accomplished by a goal that claims to itself moral superiority (with its sanctuary to the Jews victims of persecution).
Keeping the lies of a potential voluntary choice allows the responsibility of the Palestinians to be held by the misery they receive if they insist on not leaving, then download it to the Arab countries accused of refusing to accept the refugees based on a political calculation and hostility to Israel, and then to the Jews themselves.
In the end, he takes responsibility for organizations that Israel considers an existential threat, such as the UNRWA, which has been accused by Israel since its foundation in 1948 of maintaining a living refugee issue. This is the reason for which last October was enacted a law prohibiting the work of the United Nations Agency specializing in helping Palestinian refugees in Israeli territory.
The ""voluntary"" immigration option is allowed to clear a project that includes the displacement of a people from its land and at the same time preserving the moral purity of those They do it. But in practice, it is only one of the dimensions of the policy of transmission, and it is after its soft nature acquires the balance of power, in one way or another.
When the Palestinians of Gaza refused to leave in 1970, the Minister of Religious Affairs, Zorge and Warshafegh, said at the time, addressing Prime Minister Golda Meir: ""It will be better to use force if there is a need for power, but only amid a state of chaos.""
And the people of Gaza are still today, and despite what the Israeli army committed against them for 15 months, they refuse the voluntary departure from what they consider their homeland.
Unless a sustainable political framework is reached, the project to seize the Gaza Strip and remove most of the Palestinians from it in preparation for resettlement of the Jews in it remains in the minds of a huge sector of the Israeli political class, and it remains as an ambition that the settlement organizations seek to achieve - and it may be a strategic target of a crisis that is detonated in the future.
This is exactly what the government and the army began completing in the north during their recent war in the Strip.

US officials are trying to retract Trump's statements ... We will not send forces to Gaza",QA
"Correspondent of the American TV Network (NBC) went to US President Donald Trump, during the joint press conference with Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, with a question about what is the authority of the United States on the Gaza Strip that allows it to displace its residents into neighboring countries?  He replied by the businessman, that the United States will remain responsible for Gaza in the long run, and this will lead to stability in this part of the Middle East, and he added: ""Many people who spoke with them admired the idea of ??the United States to have this plot of land (Gaza Strip ) And its development to create thousands of jobs in it. Everywhere, Netanyahu expressed his support for this idea, describing it as a ""original idea"" !!
Netanyahu will not hesitate to dedicate the Gaza Strip to Trump after the displacement of its residents from it (if it is able to do so), and if the pressures of the Trump administration resulted in Egypt and Jordan, to receive the displaced Palestinians, to establish resorts, hotels, casinos and for the white slave trade, but what will Netanyahu get in return? Netanyahu, with his approval to stop The shooting with Hamas and the exchange of prisoners with it, replaced the slogan ""absolute victory"" after his failure to achieve it with the slogan ""absolute barter"", and this was evident that he was exempt to the Mossad chiefs and the Shin Bet from the leadership of indirect negotiations with Hamas, and its support to the Minister of Strategic Affairs, Trump's friend ""Ron Dream"", It indicates the vision of Netanyahu for the next day in Gaza politically.
Netanyahu is spending Trump in exchange for Israel's commitment to the ceasefire in Gaza, and the completion of the second and third phases, by including the West Bank or parts of it to Israel, displacing what Israel can displace it from, and ensuring that the United States does not support the establishment of a Palestinian state during the Trump administration negotiations with Saudi Arabia to normalize its relations with Israel, in addition to Israel obtaining American military and political support, to attack Iran to eliminate its armament capabilities and its program Nuclear.
Netanyahu also senses the danger of his disintegration of his government, in light of the position of his right -wing ally Smotrich, who threatens to demolish the temple of the Israeli government at the head of those in it, if the war does not continue on Gaza, and he also feels the risk of the end of his political future, in light of his great decline in the decline of his popularity. in Opinion polls, although he agreed to the ceasefire of the prisoner exchange. Therefore, Netanyahu sees in Trump a sacrifice for him by implementing what he promised regarding Gaza and the West Bank, and in other files related to the Middle East serving the interests of Israel, which will compensate him for the image of the failed in the war on Gaza, to appear in the form of strategic gains for Esratil, and this will serve him in staying In the ruling on if the extremist minister, Smotrich, carried out his threat to withdraw from the government, as well as to increase his popularity in Among the Israeli voters, which have declined, as recently showed in Israeli polls in Israel, despite his approval of the ceasefire, and the retrieval of Israeli prisoners from Gaza.
Trump's statements regarding the announcement of Israeli sovereignty on the West Bank or parts of it are conflicting, as he implicitly indicated in his statements before Netanyahu's visit to the White House, to support him included the West Bank by saying that the area of ??Israel is very small compared to the areas In his hand, we compared him to the area of ??the office he was sitting on. However, he announced during the joint press conference with Netanyahu, in response to a question whether he confesses With Israeli sovereignty on the West Bank by saying, ""We will discuss this with the representatives of Israel, and people love this idea, but we have not yet taken a position, and we will issue a declaration in this regard during the next four weeks."" He added, ""I do not say anything about two states, no one country, or about The lack of a state. ""
At the same press conference, in response to a question about whether it is possible to reach a normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia without establishing a Palestinian state, Netanyahu said, ""Saudi Arabia will help, it wants peace in the Middle East."" ""I think that peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia is not only possible, but will happen,"" he added. However, the response of Saudi Arabia was not late regarding the uprooting of the Palestinians from Gaza and the annexation of the West Bank of Israel, as it stated in a statement by the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ""The Kingdom refuses to uproot the Palestinians from their land, nor will it establish relations with Israel without the establishment of the Palestinian state, and that this position is not subject to To negotiate. ""
In response to Trump's statements regarding the ""purification"" of Gaza from the Palestinians, and the imposition of Israeli sovereignty on the West Bank, the Egyptian and Jordanian response came refusing this, for reasons related to defending the right of the Palestinians to live in Their homeland is in an independent state, and because these plans threaten the national security of both countries, as the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced in a statement that Egypt's rejection of any prejudice to the rights of the Palestinian people, whether through settlement or annexation of the land or by evacuating that land from its owners, through displacement, Whether it is temporary or long -term, while Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Al -Safadi announced Jordan's refusal to any attempt to displace the Palestinians, and that it will not accept any solution to the Palestinian issue at the expense of Jordan.
The positions of the American administration on the Palestinian people regarding the next day of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank (and if they do not crystallize more clearly), but these positions indicate that Israel and the United States believe that the Palestinian people are an excessive people over humanity, and they are trying to delete them, ignoring their successes in The failure of dozens of liquidation attempts since 1948, and its design, provided that its fate is not like the fate of the Red Indians, for example, so its number today reaches To 13 million people, half of them in the homeland, and the other half in the exile, and he is still insisting on returning and establishing an independent state, which confirms the impossibility of blurring his existence, and that American and Israeli plans are nothing but ""plowing in the sea"".",PS
"US President Donald Trump's statements made a political earthquake in the region and the world by announcing his desire to control the Gaza Strip and possess it for a long time, with the aim of transferring him to the Middle East ""Riviera"" after the displacement of its residents to ""forever"" to Egypt, Jordan and other countries.
This perception would not have occurred to the minds of politicians and observers, especially after Trump boasted more than once with the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, which is supposed to lead to the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation army from it, and the attempt to build it with the start of the third stage, i.e. about three months later From starting its implementation.
This position brought rejected Palestinian, Arab, especially Egypt, Jordan, international, especially the European Union, Britain, China, Russia, and the Secretary -General of the United Nations Guterres.
President Trump justified the idea of ??displacing Palestinians from Gaza, for humanitarian reasons to provide a safe and generous place for the population outside Gaza, because it is an insecure place.
The irony is that he presented this idea and Netanyahu, who is responsible for the crime of destroying Gaza, which is required to a memorandum brought to the International Criminal Court, as a war criminal because of his killing of the Palestinians and the destruction of the features of their lives in Gaza, stands beside him and smiles A wide smile in a Syrian scene, indicating the level of political cabinet and the value deviation of the guest and the host.
Instead of expiation for the American president about Washington's sin in its absolute support for the occupation and destroying the entire Gaza Strip with American weapons, it is quick to put forward ideas that amount The world's biggest power, their extremist theological beliefs simulate the destruction of the other And its debt, to build an ethnic and religious entity, in a hateful, hateful, hateful image.
It is noteworthy that after a few days of Trump launching the idea of ??displacement of the Palestinians, informed sources spoke to the New York Times that ""senior members of the American administration were shocked"", and that ""the administration did not make basic planning to examine the feasibility of the proposal,"" and Israeli sources indicated that the Israeli security services were surprised Also with this proposal, which indicates that President Trump presented a serious, superficial, superficial idea on The future of the Palestinian issue and the security of the Middle East, without a deep study of the realism of its application.
This prompted Advisers to President Trump to say that ""the idea of ??the ownership of the Gaza Strip will disappear after it became clear to the American president that it is not applicable,"" according to the New York Times, but the question, why did President Trump raised this idea, is it just a supreme thought or are there goals and goals in the mind Trump?
First: It is not excluded that this idea will be a balloon of a test of the reaction of the Palestinians and the Arab countries concerned, so if the positions are different or hesitant and weak, then Trump will advance the idea forward, to serve the occupied Israel by getting rid of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip, and then repeat Experience in the West Bank, to achieve the dream of Israel occupied in controlling the entire historical Palestine without its original residents.
And if this scenario succeeds, it will be an introduction to the Greater Israel, where the eyes of the Zionists are in southern Lebanon, Jordan and southern Syria ... and this spoke to the Minister of Finance in Salail Smotrich, who sees in Jordan a part of the promised land, and as he and the Minister of Communications Shlomo indicated that it is limits Jerusalem arrives in Damascus.
Second: If the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip is a failed idea strategically because it is not realistic, President Trump may use it as a tactical maneuver, by pretending that he will waive or reduce his roof from displacement to accepting the reconstruction of Gaza, to achieve two goals under blackmail and bargaining:
The first goal: pressure to disarm Hamas and the Palestinian resistance, and control the future of the Gaza Strip and manage it with criteria that take into account the security interests of the Israeli occupation, in exchange for its reconstruction.
The second trend: pressure on Saudi Arabia to give up the condition of the Palestinian state, and accepting normalization with occupied Israel in exchange for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, as an urgent Palestinian and Arab need, because the displacement will prepare a recipe for escalation and security turmoil in the region and its countries, especially Egypt, and Jordan.
Third: The displacement from the White House inhabitant, is a grant for Benjamin Netanyahu, to help him stabilize his government, by giving him an opportunity to market the continuation of the implementation of the second stage, from the ceasefire agreement, with his right -wing extremist allies such as the Minister of Finance in Salafel Smotrich, who threatens the collapse of the government if it is done Moving to the second stage, and here the idea of ??displacement of Gaza residents becomes a supposed price, to enforce the ceasefire agreement The fire that Washington sponsored and seen President Trump as an achievement Historical and high -speed.
The idea, although it is imagined or dreamy, becomes an interest that is used for Trump and Netanyahu, each of what it means and follows.
Some Arab countries have stood a faded or inconvenient stance in stopping the genocide that the Gaza Strip was exposed to, stating that the fire will not reach it, and that this ""neutral"" position will bring it the satisfaction of the United States of America, and the repercussions of the catastrophic scene in Gaza.
As for the matter, it went beyond the borders and moved to the security of the Arab countries, as a matter of displacement of the Palestinians, especially the threat of Egyptian national security, and the threat of Jordan's national identity on the base of the alternative homeland for the Palestinians, according to the Israeli vision, the matter has become urgent and necessary to take a firm position and strictly refuse to displace Then the rush to protect the Palestinian presence in Gaza, through relief and reconstruction without delay or procrastination; So that the occupied Israel or President Trump does not remain an argument or an excuse.
Supporting Gaza and supporting the Palestinian people in the face of the Israeli occupation, constitutes immunity for the Palestinian issue, as it is an interest for the Arab countries; The Palestinian steadfastness is a decisive factor for the Israeli occupation of the appetite of the colonial settlement expansion, Israel has the ability to threaten the interests of Arab countries.
The arrogance of the Israeli expansionist power, and the extreme position of President Trump, requires serious and strong Arab positions, especially from Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, especially in light of Trump's reference and American officials, that Arab regimes talk in the media about something and behind the scenes about something else, and this is what makes the Arab position Decisive and historical to protect Arab interests, foremost of which is the interests of countries that have not interfered with them Normalizing its relations with occupied Israel.
The Western system, led by Washington, and President Trump, cannot be appreciated and only respectful, and they only measure matters according to the logic of interests, and this principle must be a standard for the Arab position, which has the papers of political, economic and geographical power that makes the Arab region the heart of the world and the nerve of international trade.
It is sufficient for Egypt and Jordan to loosen their relations and peace agreements with occupied Israel until the latter and Washington re -consider their catastrophic policies on the Palestinian issue and on Arab national security.
The existential repercussions of the Israeli occupation policies, deserve to be a bold steps to raise the roof The politician is in front of everyone who threatens the fate of the region and the fate of the Palestinian issue.
The truth was and will remain that occupied Israel is an absolute evil, and the Zionist project is a strategic threat to the security of the Arab countries and the interests of their peoples, no matter how some people try to tame peace or make concessions.

"Over the past decades, and the external politics of the Arab Republic of Egypt, it is pushing for development and renewal, especially in the twenty -one and twenty -one centuries.
As Egyptian -Israeli relations were one of the decisive factors of the entire Middle East policy, and at the beginning of the twenty -first century it was and still was the foreign policy of the Arab Republic of Egypt, multi -directional and very active, in addition to solving the problem of the Arab -Israeli conflict, as the ""country of the pyramids"" attaches great attention to the neighboring situation of its borders Where Cairo is concerned with moderate regulations that do not participate in regional conflicts and in this regard, there is no doubt that Cairo's relations are fine With its Arab neighbors on the African continent - Libya and Sudan.
The Egyptian foreign policy towards the Israeli -Palestinian conflict was to emphasize that the essence of the problem is the occupation of the Palestinian territories by the Israeli forces, the violence against civilians, the building of settlements in the occupied territories, and many other illegal acts carried out by the Israeli government. The Egyptian position calls for the withdrawal of the Israeli forces until the 1967 borders and the implementation of the legitimate right of the people The Palestinian in establishing his state, and this reflects Egypt's position on the Palestinian issue, and that it is interested in reaching a political solution to this problem, which gives hope that the Arab -Israeli relations will move from the world of confrontation to the world of mutual understanding, peaceful coexistence and cooperation in the future.
This is what Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi stressed in all his meetings and statements that the establishment of an independent Palestinian state is the best way to ensure the security of the Palestinian and Israeli peoples, ""and that the Palestinians will never accept the presence of Israeli forces on their lands to protect the Jewish settlements.
In the Palestinian path related to the bridge of the rift between the Palestinian brothers, Egypt made a great effort to be a ""only active mediator"" in the dilemma of the internal Palestinian division and excelled and held reconciliation conferences between the various Palestinian movements more than once in Cairo, and I am still making efforts to reach a point The agreement of the Fatah and Hamas movement to agree on a joint committee to manage the affairs of the sector after the war stopped on Gaza.
In light of the war of the Egyptian position, both at the official and popular level, it constantly emphasizes its rejectionist position For any attempts to displace the residents of the Gaza Strip, and this refusal reflects the role of Egypt and the Egyptian leadership, headed by President Abdel Fattah El -Sisi for the rights of the Palestinians.
The displacement of the population is a violation of human rights, which leads to the exacerbation of humanitarian crises, and Egypt realizes that any operation of the displacement of the Palestinians ends the Palestinian issue and deprives the Palestinian people of their right to self -determination and establish an independent state.
On the other hand, Egypt considers any attempts to displace the Palestinians that will lead to a state of instability in the entire region and create new crises.
In the end, the Egyptian diplomatic and humanitarian role in the Gaza Strip constitutes a pivotal role in promoting regional stability and alleviating human suffering, by providing urgent assistance to the residents of Gaza, by opening the crossings, facilitating the entry of food and medical aid, as well as the continuation of its endeavors with international and Arab organizations To ensure the arrival of aid effectively and quickly, as Egypt was and the safety valve for the Palestinian issue and the protective shield is still against The plan to displace the Palestinian people, especially as it was the main and effective role in mediation efforts between the Palestinians, and the support efforts Palestinians in establishing their independent state, which reflects its deep commitment to the Palestinian cause and the rights of the Palestinian people.",PS
"The Euro -Mediterranean Observatory warned of the escalation of forced displacement waves carried out by the Israeli army against the Palestinians in the West Bank, describing it as ""a reproduction of the crime of genocide."" The Observatory confirmed that the Israeli military operations in the Al -Fara'a refugee camp in Tubas, which started since the second of February, included wide raids and the destruction of homes and infrastructure, in addition to imposing a curfew.
According to the observatory reports, the pressure that resulted from the siege, starvation, and threats to bombing homes have pushed hundreds of Palestinian families to forcibly displacement, amid harsh conditions, as these families were forced to leave their homes through paths identified by the Israeli forces.
The Observatory continued that the occupation army had displaced the majority of the residents of Jenin camp, whose number is estimated at more than 13,000 Palestinians, in addition to the displacement of more than 11,000 residents of the Tulkarm and Nour Shams camps. The Observatory considered these operations one of the broadest campaigns of forced displacement in the West Bank for decades.

Who supports Trump's plans?",UK
"The words of US President Donald Trump about the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip still interact, the last of which is what the Israeli Channel 12 spoke of, last Wednesday, that there are three regions of Trump's thinking about the transfer of Gaza residents to it, which are the Puntland and Somalland region (or the unrecognized separatist land region of Somalia International) and Morocco. This has sparked a wave of reactions in the Arab and Somali digital platforms, and Arab and Somali media singled out a wide space in its news and analytical programs for this, and this was accompanied by a number of fallacies regarding the validity of the Buntland regional information and Somaliland located in northeastern Somalia.
Source in the Somali Foreign Ministry: We will not accept the displacement of the Palestinians
Source in the Somali Foreign Ministry: We will not accept the displacement of the Palestinians
The displacement of the Palestinians from Gaza
On this, a source in the Somali Foreign Ministry confirmed to Al -Arabi Al -Jadeed that Somalia will in no way accept the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, and will not be part of the policy of displacement that Washington is planning against the Palestinians. The source pointed out that the federal government is not about to comment on the news of the displacement of the Palestinians, which is reported by the local media And Arabic, indicating that what is currently rumored is just leaks and rumors only promoted by Hebrew media. The source pointed out that the Somali Foreign Ministry will be commented on this news if official statements were issued by the White House regarding the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza to areas in Buntland or Somaliland, which Mogadishu considers part of.
According to the Hebrew Channel 12, Somalland and Bontland, which are a region in Somalia, are not recognized internationally as two independent states, urgently needed recognition by the United States. But the information of the channel is incorrect, because the Puntland region has not sought since its inception in 1998 diplomatic recognition and did not ask to separate from Somalia or something similar Deep between the Somali government and the federal state of Buntland due to bad Understanding in how to organize the presidential elections scheduled for 2026, and these differences emerged in 2024 when the Federal Parliament approved a project to amend the provisions of the Somali constitution and form independent electoral committees, which is what The Puntland government, which later announced its withdrawal of its recognition from the federal government, angered its intention to independence or secession.
As for the Somaliland region, which was actually established in 1992, he seemed to seek international recognition and declared its separation from Somalia, but it did not enjoy international or regional recognition, but in recent months, lawmakers in the US Congress began to pressure the Trump electoral team to make efforts to recognize Somalland as an independent state, but that The efforts are still in the context of speculation and have not yet resulted in little results. In this regard, the Somali Ambassador to Washington, Taher Arab, said in an interview with the media spokesperson for Somali, recently, that the United States will not recognize the Somaliland region, claiming that there is no major reason to recognize this region currently an independent country in the Horn of Africa. He explained that ""Washington will respect international laws, and I do not think it will be part of the policies of dividing Somalia, as this step can lead to serious repercussions on the security and stability of the African Horn region."" Arabs pointed out that the Somalia unit is not negotiable, and that Mogadishu will resort to all diplomatic and options.

"Moussa Abu Marzouq, deputy head of the political bureau of ""Hamas"" abroad, which indicated the movement's readiness to communicate directly with Washington, raised many questions about the seriousness of this step and whether it represents a strategic shift in the ""Hamas"" policy, or is it just An attempt to improve its post -war international image in the Gaza Strip.

A book, political analysts, specialists, and university professors, in separate conversations with ""?"", believes that Abu Marzouk's statements may reflect Hamas's desire to search for legal legitimacy and international recognition, especially in light of its actual control over many aspects of life in Gaza, while they see This step may come within the framework of a new American policy under President Donald Trump, who seeks to leave a legacy as a peacemaker.

They point out that, however, the challenges are great for both parties, on the one hand, Hamas faces legal challenges as it is on the American terrorist list, in addition to fundamental issues, such as: recognition of Israel, rejecting violence and delivering weapons, and on the other hand, the American administration needs to Congress approves any steps related to opening a dialogue with ""Hamas"", and these obstacles make it difficult to predict The success of any future dialogue, in addition to the presence of Palestinian internal divisions and the lack of a national consensus on how to deal with these developments.

""Hamas"" desire to search for legal legitimacy and international recognition

The writer, political analyst and professor of international relations at the Arab American League, Dr. Amjad Abu Al -Ezz, believes that the willingness of the ""Hamas"" movement to open a dialogue with the United States reflects the movement's desire to search for legal legitimacy and international recognition, especially in light of its actual control over many aspects of life in Gaza Strip.

Abu El -Ezz explains that this step comes within the framework of a new era of American policy under the leadership of former President Donald Trump, who seeks to leave a legacy as a peacemaker.

Abu Al -Ezz notes that the United States started practical steps on the ground by sending security companies based on army forces and retired officers to the checkpoints in Natsarim, which indicates the need for understanding or initial agreements between the two parties that necessitated the opening of the dialogue.

Abu El -Ezz believes that ""Hamas"" wants to open communication lines with the United States in search of legal legitimacy, and it may be part of a regional deal through which the movement is contained through Certain understandings, such as avoiding war with Israel in exchange for allowing its representatives to participate in a government or any kind of agreements.

Abu Al -Ezz notes that Trump wants to deal with players on the ground, which opens the door to the possibility of opening a direct line between ""Hamas"" and the United States in the next stage, whether it is through tactical initiatives to enhance the truce and release the prisoners, or as part of a broader strategy To deal with the Middle East.

Abu Al -Ezz notes that the challenges are great for both parties. On the one hand, Hamas faces legal challenges as they are on the American terrorist list, in addition to major issues, such as recognition of Israel, rejecting violence and handing over weapons, which are issues that Hamas cannot make decisions regarding Easily, on the other hand, Trump needs Congress' approval of any steps related to opening a dialogue with ""Hamas"".

Abu El -Ezz explains that the experience of dialogue with the United States is not new for the Palestinians, as the PLO began dialogue with Washington in the 1970s, but this dialogue stopped because of Yasser Arafat's refusal to condemn some Palestinian operations, indicating that he is supposed to ""Hamas"" to learn from The organization's experience, but it faces great challenges in achieving a balance between its Palestinian project and its regional projects.

Abu Al -Ezz believes that Hamas must open a dialogue with the PLO to achieve a consensus on all points, including resistance and relations with Israel and neighboring countries, instead of searching for channels with the United States of America.

Abu El -Ezz stresses that any dialogue with the United States must be supported by a unified Palestinian legal umbrella, to avoid tactical exercises that may weaken Palestinians in the long run.

Abu Al -Ezz calls for a comprehensive national dialogue to implement national unity on the ground, to block the path of any plans and programs that may not be commensurate with the aspirations of the Palestinians and their legitimate political rights.

Abu Al -Ezz believes that President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) can play a pivotal role at this stage by offering an initiative for national dialogue that includes everyone, including the ""Hamas"" movement, which pulls the rug from under any channels of dialogue that is not in line with the national consensus.

Abu Al -Ezz warns that the reconstruction of Gaza with a purely economic perspective may ignore the political and radical dimensions of the Palestinian issue, which raises questions about the extent The ability of this dialogue to meet the legitimate rights of Palestinians without falling into any political trap.

""Hamas"" fell into a great wearing about a visit to Witkeov

The writer and political analyst Akram Atallah believes that the Hamas movement signed a great wear on Stephen Whitchov's visit, the American special envoy to President Donald Trump, to the Gaza Strip, where ""Hamas"" believed that Witkeov will visit Gaza at the head of an independent American delegation through a crossing Rafah or the Beit Hanoun crossing, without realizing that the visit will take place under the Israeli security and administrative cover, and that Israel will be organized For this visit.

Atallah notes that this confusion prompted Hamas to announce its willingness to secure protection for the American delegation, a statement followed by another statement by Musa Abu Marzouk, in which he confirmed the movement's readiness to open a dialogue with the United States of America, as these statements were built on a wrong assumption.

Atallah is not more likely that the United States of America can open a dialogue with Hamas, for several reasons, including the firm American decision to end the movement of the movement in Gaza, which is compatible with the Israeli position.

Atallah refers to tweets issued by US President Donald Trump And the American National Security Adviser, which emphasized that ""there is no place for armed organizations in Gaza"", and called for ""the skin of Gaza and its rebuilding.""

These statements, according to Atallah, reflect a match in the American and Israeli vision regarding the necessity of ending the role of ""Hamas"" as an armed resistance movement.

Atallah confirms that ""Hamas"" will face great difficulties even if the United States opens a dialogue with it, because the American conditions will be inconsistent with the nature and composition Hamas as an Islamic resistance movement.

Atallah explains that the ""Hamas"" movement has been resisting the occupation, and if the United States stripped it of its weapon, it will take it off the justification of its primary existence.

Atallah notes that the recent statements of ""Hamas"" regarding its willingness to dialogue with the United States came as a result of a wrong assumption, as the movement believed that the American envoy would arrive in Gaza through the Egyptian Rafah crossing, without realizing that the visit would take place under the mantle of the Israeli occupation.

Atallah believes that ""Hamas"" stands in front of a big dilemma, as any dialogue with the United States It will be required to make fundamental concessions that contradict its basic principles, and at the same time, the continuation of the isolation of the international movement may increase its internal and external pressures, which puts it in an existential dilemma that is difficult to get out of it without radical changes in its policy and strategy.

A deep political position stems from the realization of ""Hamas"", the size of the crisis

The writer and political analyst d. Ahmed Rafik Awad said that the statements of Musa Abu Marzouq, which indicated the movement's desire to open new communication channels with the current American administration, is not just a diplomatic courtesy, but rather reflects a deep political position stemming from the realization of ""Hamas"" of the size of the crisis it faces.

Awad notes that after the disastrous destruction of the Gaza Strip, and the strict military and political blockade, Hamas feels that it is in an existential predicament, this impasse is not limited to the military or material side only, but also extends to the political side, where Hamas feels that There are international and regional efforts aimed at ""deleting"" the political equation.

Awad notes that ""Hamas"" may be prepared to adopt new policies, which may include a shift to a fully political movement, or even to abandon the administration of the Gaza Strip as part of a political settlement More, these steps may aim to open closed doors with the American administration, and to search for new partners in the region, including the Palestinian Authority, in order to achieve Palestinian reconciliation that allows a deeper dialogue with the international community.

Dr. Instead of fundamental questions about the future of ""Hamas"": Can the movement turn into a purely political entity? Can you recognize Israel as part of a political settlement? Will it accept an Arab or international administration for the Gaza Strip? These questions reflect the great challenges facing ""Hamas"", especially in light of the tremendous pressures they are exposed to.

Awad believes that ""Hamas"" may deal with multiple scenarios that preserve its political and military existence, but it excludes that the movement will offer any reward for Israel, such as recognition of it, after the destruction of Gaza, however, Hamas may be ready to deal with Arab proposals American aims to achieve a long -term calm, or even participate in security and political arrangements that guarantee relatively stability in Gaza.

Awad notes that one of the great challenges facing ""Hamas"" is how to build confidence with the international and regional community. Even if the movement provides guarantees regarding its political intentions, it is difficult Its belief in its complex military and political history, and the delivery of weapons, which is one of the main international demands, may make ""Hamas"" very weak and unable to impose its conditions in any future negotiations.

Awad believes that the Hamas movement may resort to dramatic options, including entering into a secret or public dialogue with the American administration, in order to preserve its political and military presence in the Gaza Strip, and this dialogue may include painful settlements, but it may be necessary to ensure the survival Movement under the current circumstances.

Awad notes that this trend may also be driven by the current American policy, especially with President Donald Trump's return to the political interface, so Trump, known for his fast dealings and firmness, may represent an opportunity for Hamas to achieve quick political and security arrangements in the Gaza Strip.

But Awad warns that any solo dialogue between ""Hamas"" and the United States may negatively affect the unified strategic vision of the Palestinians, and weakens the idea of ??an independent Palestinian state, and this dialogue may create new divisions within the Palestinian political scene, which complicates national reconciliation efforts.

Awad believes that ""Hamas"" stands at a crossroads, where you must It must balance between preserving its principles and winning new international legitimacy, and this exact balance may be the key to the movement of the movement in light of the changing political conditions in the region and the world.

A qualitative development in political dynamics

Professor d. Jamal Harfoush, professor of curricula of scientific research and political studies at the University of the Academic Center for Research in Brazil, that the statements of Musa Abu Marzouk, deputy head of the political bureau of the ""Hamas"" movement abroad, on the movement's willingness to open a dialogue with the United States and provide protection for US President Donald Trump's envoy It is a qualitative development in Palestinian and international political dynamics.

Harfoush explains that this step may open new horizons for various diplomatic paths, which may involve the reformulation of the relationship between the United States and the Palestinian political movements.

Harfoush confirms that this initiative is considered an attempt by ""Hamas"" to expand the circle of international actors involved in the Palestinian issue, which may contribute to breaking the current stalemate.

Harfoush confirms that this development is an indication of a new flexibility adopted by ""Hamas"", especially in light of the urgent need to improve conditions Humanitarian and economic in the Gaza Strip, and this step may reflect Hamas's desire to highlight itself as an active and responsible party capable of communicating with influential international parties.

In practice, Harfoush notes that the success of these paths depends on the United States ’response to this offer, and its willingness to reconsider its traditional policies towards the Hamas movement, as this step may constitute a gateway to rearrange the papers on the Palestinian scene if it is exploited wisely And knowing.

Harfoush explains that ""Hamas"" as a resistance movement has its own political and military approach, and since its inception it has adopted a different position for the Palestine Liberation Organization regarding the recognition of Israel, while the PLO ended up with the Oslo agreements in which it recognized Israel as part of the settlement path, and the position of Hamas remains the position of ""Hamas"" and remains the position of Hamas. It focuses on the historical rights of the Palestinian people, and refused to make any concession related to the principle of national sovereignty or the waiver of lands.

However, Harfoush notes that ""Hamas"" today works within a different political reality, which requires her to consider a strategy to achieve concrete gains for the Palestinian people while preserving national constants, so it can be said that Hamas, if it is involved in any dialogue path, may start from the basis of reassessing field conditions and needs without this means adopting identical positions with the PLO, but rather building different strategies commensurate with their vision and principles.

Harfoush confirms that the known American conditions for dialogue, which include recognition of Israel, rejecting violence, and commitment to previous agreements, has always been an obstacle to any communication between ""Hamas"" and the American administration, however, politics is the art of possible, and depends on flexibility and adaptation to variables.

Harfoush confirms that ""Hamas"", as it seems from the statements of its leaders, does not deal with these conditions in an absolute acceptance or rejection form, but rather starts from a pragmatic approach that seeks to achieve the interests of its people within the available political framework, and that the movement's willingness to provide protection for an American envoy and his visit to Gaza may be An implicit message that there is preparation for dialogue without giving up the fundamental principles.

Harfoush believes that ""Hamas"" is unlikely to make initial concessions that contradict its national vision, but it may seek to find a formula of understanding that achieves a balance between the requirements of political reality and the rights of the non -negative Palestinian people To behave, but the question remains open about the extent of the parties' ability to create a dialogue environment that enables to overcome pre -conditions and reach compromises that serve everyone.

Providing a realistic policy model in the post -war stage

The writer and political analyst Suleiman Bisharat believes that the willingness of Hamas to open a dialogue with the United States reflects the movement's desire to present a realistic model for the post -war policy on the Gaza Strip.

Bisharat explains that ""Hamas"" seeks not to anticipate the international community, but rather wants to appear as an open power to political solutions that can restore some rights to the Palestinian issue.

Bisharat confirms that this step indicates political realism in international relations, especially in light of the new international composition with the arrival of US President Donald Trump, who holds political visions and projects he wants to impose, whether the Palestinians accepted or not.

Bisharat stresses that the political intelligence of the Palestinians lies in how to deal with this stage without exception any component of the Palestinian components.

Bisharat notes that the future paths of the Palestinian issue require severe caution and awareness, in addition to a Palestinian unit and an inclusive discourse that expresses rights Fully Palestinian.

Bisharat confirms that any future dialogue with any international party must start from an integrated Palestinian ground and a comprehensive Palestinian understanding, which requires an internal Palestinian dialogue before opening any future doors with the international parties.

Bisharat warns that Israeli measures in the West Bank and Gaza Strip indicate the existence of a future Israeli vision, which may intersect with the American vision, which leads to the necessity of a unified Palestinian to reduce the damage that may be caused to the Palestinian cause.

Bisharat confirms that there is an urgent need for a comprehensive political umbrella for the whole Palestinian that is a basic title at this stage.

Bisharat notes that major conflicts are witnessing articulated stations, as happened in the American war on Afghanistan and the Syrian situation, where political doors were opened to forces that were classified as terrorist, stressing that this does not mean that ""Hamas"" could be a substitute for the Palestine Liberation Organization, but rather it is necessary That there is a comprehensive political umbrella for the whole Palestinian.

Bisharat explains that the United States may try to adapt ""Hamas"" in the political paths, but it will not deal with it from the principle of goodwill, but will impose a political path that may be forced by Hamas, Hamas. I accept it, pointing out that ""Hamas"" is a balance between its principles and political realism, which puts it in a very sensitive stage.

It indicates that the current stage is a stage of labor, and it is not possible to assert the path that the Palestinian issue will take, especially with the rapid changes at the internal, regional and international levels.

Bisharat believes that the future American vision of the Middle East and the Palestinian cause are still unclear, which makes it early to judge the directions of this stage.

Bisharat explains that ""Hamas"" is facing great pressure in the balance of its principles with political realism, especially in light of its fear of losing the support of its fans.

Bisharat believes that this stage requires an internal Palestinian dialogue to create compatible pillars that can be launched in the next stage.

Bisharat confirms that it is too early to talk about opening a comprehensive dialogue between ""Hamas"" and the United States, but he confirms that any future dialogue must be launched from an integrated Palestinian ground and a unified political discourse that fully expresses Palestinian rights.

Direct dialogue opportunities are still small in the short term

The professor of political science at Al -Quds Open University, Qusai Hamed, believes that Musa's statements Abu Marzouq, Vice -President of the Political Bureau of Hamas abroad, for the American New York Times, about the movement's willingness to open a comprehensive dialogue with the United States and facilitate a visit to Whimkov, reflects Hamas's desire to overcome obstacles to opening channels directly with the Trump administration, and its willingness to agree On new arrangements regarding the Gaza Strip, including the acceptance of the Gaza administration or rule by an agreed upon one, without there being a direct participation from Movement. But in the broader framework, Hamed believes that ""Hamas"" sends messages to the United States and the international community that the movement is open to dialogue and political approach, and that the policy of exclusion and siege in addition to the military strikes launched by Israel during its war on the Gaza Strip, and targeting its political and military leaders, all of which failed in Eliminating the movement, and that ""Hamas"" was able to rearrange its ranks and appear in the appearance of the victor.

Hamed notes that the opportunities for direct dialogue between ""Hamas"" and the United States are still small in the short term, despite the presence of some dialogues related to the completion of the exchange deal and the ""next day"" arrangements in the Gaza Strip, which takes place through intermediaries.

Hamed notes that the administration The American is aware of the difficulty of excluding ""Hamas"" from any future arrangements in Gaza, despite its attempts to reduce the movement's role in these arrangements.

With regard to the visit of Trump's envoy to Gaza, Hamed believes that the security complications associated with this visit may reduce the chances of completing it in the near future, especially that facilitating it requires coordination with ""Hamas"", whether directly or indirectly, to provide security protection, and that any visit from This type will be a discussion between the American administration and ""Hamas"" through intermediaries.

As for the involvement of ""Hamas"" with a political path with Israel, Hamid believes that ""Hamas"" does not mind this, provided that it is a feasible path and leads to the Palestinians achieving their hopes and aspirations in a state on the borders of June 4, 1967.

Hamed believes that ""Hamas"" has gone an advanced way to determine its position on this and culminates in 2017 by issuing the public policy document in which it showed an openness to establishing a Palestinian state on the borders of 1967, but the two issues of recognition of Israel or abandoning weapons remain not subject to concession.

Hamed believes that linking the United States accepting the dialogue with Hamas with traditional conditions (recognition of Israel and abandoning work Military) illogical.

However, Hamed believes that the communication lines between ""Hamas"" and the United States may be indirectly condensed, especially in light of the new arrangements that the American administration plans regarding the Gaza Strip.

Hamed believes that Abu Marzouq's statements, which came in an interview with an American newspaper, represents a diplomatic message addressed to decision makers in the United States, confirming that ""Hamas"" is still a political and military force influencing the Palestinian scene, and that its exception to any future arrangements will be difficult , Especially in light of Israel's failure to achieve its military targets in Gaza more than 440 days of confrontations.",PS
"Although some believe that the departure of the Secretary -General of Hezbollah, Sheikh Naim Qassem, to announce the refusal to extend the sixty -day period of the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Lebanese territories, came outside the context hours after the announcement of the Lebanese government in which the party is represented as the Speaker of the Parliament Nabih Berri who And all by negotiating it throughout the last war, they followed the extension. It does not concern us neither from near nor from far and does not exist in our calendar. ”

This party's position sparked many people, while others put it in the framework of the maneuvering style that the party used to avoid frustrating its environment, especially after thousands flocked to their villages since last Sunday with the end of the sixty -day period stipulated in the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah.


Hezbollah Secretary General Naim Qasim in a televised speech on Monday (Reuters)
Declared situations
Qasim stressed in a speech, on Monday, that the extension of the deadline for Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon means that ""we are facing an occupation that is assaulting and refusing to withdraw, and the resistance has the right to act what it deems appropriate about the form of confrontation And its nature and timing, ""stressing that"" Israel must withdraw with the passage of sixty days, and we do not accept any justification for extending one day and we do not accept the extension of the deadline. ""

On Sunday evening, the White House announced the extension of the arrangements for the ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel until February 18th, and the start of American mediation talks on the return of the Lebanese prisoners who were captured after October 7, 2023.

The head of the caretaker government, Naguib Mikati, announced that Lebanon agreed to extend the deadline for not giving Israel any excuse for not withdrawing from all Lebanese territory. The Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri explained that he stipulated an immediate ceasefire, breaches, house destruction, and others, in addition to pledged the issue of the prisoners.

Persians and dismissal of obligations
Dr. Sami Nader, Director of the Mashreq Center for Strategic Affairs, considered that “(Hezbollah) used to adopt this method in terms of playing contradictions to expand the margin of its maneuver and disavow any commitment, and this is dangerous; He keeps himself outside the framework of legitimacy in what is a representative in the Council of Ministers and the authority takes what he wants from it and dismisses his decisions when he likes it.

While Nader was excluded in a statement Asharq Al -Awsat has the withdrawal of Israel during the new deadline specified on February 18, it is suggested that ""the argument that Hezbollah's weapon is a threat to it, especially since the content of the ceasefire agreement allows it to do so. Despite the defeat incurred by (Hezbollah), Israel has not achieved its goal from the recent war by returning the residents of Galilee to their homes, knowing that the only party that is able to force Israel to withdraw is the United States of America.
